Time for a tea break, time for a Pure Leaf. We go walking in the dark. We go walking in the dark. We go walking in the dark. Where were you when you first heard Connie's music? I was at a holiday party, minding my own business, and a song came up on the House Mix. That sounded like something I'd known all my life, and also like something I knew I was here for the first time. as the melodies and lyrics were unfolding. It would start to remind me of some of my favorite song. And I was so struck by the... I just couldn't quite place it. You know, like, what is this? It just was completely original, you know, and sort of from another... I don't know, I don't think another planet, but just sort of not placeable and the voice, of course. It's an unusual voice. It doesn't sound like anybody else. She had a tremendously direct way of delivering songs and there's a simplicity to her language. She was just being herself, you know, and you can really hear that in the music. I asked the host of the party who we were listening to. And he said, oh, this is Connie Converse. She made these recordings in the 1950s in her apartment in Greenwich Village. As he told me that I realized, okay, well, I don't know who Connie Converse is. This is Howard Fishman. He's a writer and musician. Given the quality of the music, I absolutely should know who Connie Converse is. At the party that night, his friend told them the story he'd heard about her. That one day in 1974, Connie Converse drove away and disappeared. Her friends and family never heard from her again. No body was ever found. My first thought was that it was a hoax, and that there could be no such person as Connie Converse. The name seemed to fantastic. The story seemed to fantastic. So I thought it was a hoax. I thought it was somebody who had created a fictional character, but who was making this music today. That was my first thought. But then I soon realized this is actually a true story, and this woman actually existed. And I quickly realized that there was, very little in the way of information about her life available anywhere. And in 2022, Raider Hoonif Abdore keep wrote that he was fascinated by Connie Converse, because, quote, I have found myself newly sensitive to the art of disappearance, and how it is not, or at least not always, aligned with death. Sometimes a desire to be gone is simply a desire to be gone. This year is the 50th anniversary of Connie Converse's disappearance. I'm Phoebe Judge. This is criminal. After Howard Fishman heard Connie Converse's music, he tried to find out everything he could about her. He's been researching her for more than 10 years. And he became friends with her brother, Phil Converse, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. Her brother invited Howard to come visit him in Ann Arbor and look at the papers, Connie had left behind. And when Howard got there, he realized it wasn't just a handful of letters. It was a little bit of an out of body experience just because of the quantity and depth of what she'd left behind and the intentionality of the way that she left it. very well organized with a nine page table of contents, including where everything was in every folder and every drawer. And it seems clear to me that this archive had been assembled for the intention of being found one day. There were diaries, hundreds of letters organized by recipient, tape recordings and poetry she'd written throughout her life. Some of the earliest writings included her correspondence with her best friend, Franny Flint. They grew up together in New Hampshire. When Franny was 16, she was sent away to boarding school. She told Connie, I only wish you could be in my place, for you could go out and show the world something wonderful, which is you. Howard Fishman says that even before her friend moved away, Connie was an overachiever. And after Franny lefty rights, she became even more so. In his words, almost pathologically so. She was editor of the yearbook. She worked on the school newspaper, was a member of the debate club, sang in the choir, and played violin in the orchestra. She was also the valedictorian of her high school class. She and Franny wrote often. Franny sent Connie a mysterious telegram, right before graduation. All it said was, may there be no weeds between your mansion and antiquity tonight. The letters aren't really quite beautiful and quite unusual in their precrociousness and their sort of forward thinking and introspection. It seems pretty clear that they were thinking about some pretty deep things. Franny called Connie Proff and her letters and she once wrote, What is life? I see there is less in it all the time. I'm grown and done. Anything after now is just repetition. The summer after she graduated from high school, Connie worked as a waitress at a local hotel. She was going to Mount Holyoke for college that fall, just like her mother and grandmother. Franny would be going to Vassar. By all accounts, Connie did well at Mount Holyoke. She wrote one of the school's magazines Am I disloyal to high new hamster peaks when I love a Massachusetts mountain? She took classes in French and philosophy and wrote for the school's literary magazines. She was one of eight college students in the country nominated for a prize in poetry. One of the poems she submitted was called Reduction to Obserterty. It reads, I think that I shall just regress for Middle Youth to Childishness. from cover fields of infancy to restless prenatality. And then arrive where good souls go, a cold and tired embryo. And then, one day in 1944, after finishing herself more year, she abruptly told the college that she wasn't coming back. Connie's brother Phil said their parents were devastated. Phil never knew why Connie left school. Phil told me that they'd never had a conversation about it, and that he just assumed that if Connie thought it was what was best, then it must be what was best, and he left it at that. Phil says, Connie didn't move home after she dropped out. Howard couldn't find any letters or diary entries from the time. I mean, I spent, you know, about a dozen years researching this woman's story, I could never pin her to any location in the nine months following her dropping out of Mount Holyoke and then popping up in New York for the first time in February of 1945. So she seems to have pulled her first disappearing act at that time at age 20. In 1945, Connie got a job in New York City at a think tank called the American Council of the Institute for Pacific Relations. First, as an editorial assistant, but soon she was writing articles about American policies in Asia. Connie Converse, without an undergraduate degree, somehow found her way not only into this organization, but within a couple of years, writing for them, writing very scholarly articles about these topics and being published, and also editing other people's writings about these topics. So that was the milieu that she was in for the first five years or so that she was in New York. She was unbelievably intelligent. and always trying to figure things out. I think that was sort of a prevailing theme of her life. How can I figure this thing out? How can I make this thing better? Connie started making friends in New York. Howard describes them as a crowd of artists and musicians who often had late night parties. He interviewed some of Connie's friends from that time. One remembered that Connie would often be at the typewriter as though oblivious to what the group was doing. In her diary, Connie wrote, I suppose that if I were more ardent and competent conversationalist, I should not feel impelled to type up by arguments, metaphors, insights, and analogies. Many of the people I talked with said, you know, I really didn't know her that well. She was hard to know. She seems reserved, complete within herself, but not easy to to get to know. At another party, an apartment on the 3rd or 4th floor, one of her friends remembered Connie suddenly stood up, opened the window, and climbed outside. And there was nothing out there but a very thin ledge, no fire escape, no landing, and she would be out there for hours. A little while later she reappeared, coming out of another room in the apartment, she seemed to have climbed back in through a different window. Connie's best friend from high school, Franny Flint, moved to New York after she graduated from Vassar. And for a very brief window of time, the two best friends were living in New York at the same time. getting their start on life. And it's an image that has pointed and fun to think about. But within just a few months, Franny Flynn's father had a series of heart attacks. She was called back home to Concord, Nehamsher, and after her father died, rather than returning to New York, Franny Flint, then went with her mother to Boston, to enroll in graduate school at Radcliffe. And her mother got a job at Radcliffe as well. Franny Flint's brother was studying at Harvard. within a year or so for any flint, sank into a pretty bad depression and was found dead in the woods in Whalen, Massachusetts around Thanksgiving of 1947. That is Connie Ria. All we know is what Phil remembered. He said to me on many occasions because he would bring up for any Flint a lot. Tony was upset about the community's reaction to Franny Flint's death, which was rule to suicide. And the community felt that having had her father recently die, how could she do this to her brother and mother? How could she take this kind of selfish action? Phil Converse said that he remembers his sister saying that everyone has a right to do away with themselves if they want, and she was incredibly angry at the community and at their response according to him. Connie Converse was 23 years old. Two years later, she started to record her own music. We'll be right back. Hi, it's Phoebe.

The committee's goal was to investigate anyone suspected of having communist ties. Senator Joseph McCarthy had accused Connie's editor of being the top Soviet agent in North America. Connie lost her job. And that begins the next period of her life where she is really focused on trying to make it as a musician and a songwriter. In 1949, the best-selling songs in the country were by artists like The Andrew Sisters, Perry Komo, and Bing Crossby. At that time, the pop music of America was pretty bland stuff. Benny Goodman and Jazz and Swing and Big Band Music and Tin Pan Alley. There was no such thing really as singer-songwriters at that time, and there was a folk scene for sure, but folk music in 1949, 1950, 1954, these years at Cunningcon versus Writing Music, folk music at that time was music that was Traditional music. It wasn't written by anybody. It was handed down and passed around early. So I think people sometimes inaccurately today describe Connie Converse as a folk singer, which is it's just entirely inaccurate. Because at the time that she was writing these songs, if you were a folk singer, you were singing traditional songs that had no known composer, no known lyricist. I knew a man once very long ago. They say that he was born in Marfa, but I don't believe it. Marfa law was never sufficiently killer and poor. Connie taught herself to play guitar. She wrote, I used to think a guitar was a vulgar and unpleasing instrument, but if treated properly, it rises above the realm of the musical cliché. and with a good song, even cliches sound good. For the next few years, she wrote a lot of songs. Connie wrote in her diary, a good song must imply its own harmony. To test, whistle at Acapella. Here she is, recording herself. Hello. Hello. Now I have the microphone on, I have the volume on five. And I have the microphone in input one. And I'm getting a reading of up as far as... She sent copies of her music to her brother Phil and his wife, Jean. They called it her song of the month club. And then as she finished a song, she would pack it up and... envelope and mail it to Phil and Jean in Arbor so that they could hear it and also said that Phil and Jean could play the songs themselves. Phil played guitar and Jean sang and I think they did a lot of playing Connie Combers's songs at home. For money, Connie worked at a tempo agency and did some freelance writing. She eventually found a permanent job at a print shop and publisher. But she wrote to her brother, I am furtively exploring the concrete commercial alleys of the songwriting racket. Just in case, there might be a bucket for me. One thing's giving Connie's parents visited her in New York, and she played them some of her music for the first time. She recorded the performance. On the tape, you can hear her mother say, oh, I really like that one. One of the songs Connie played for her family was called Talking Like You. See that bird, sitting on my window, saying, what they say in with their will, all the night through. See that brook running by my kitchen door, running couldn't talk no more. If it was you, of that tree, that sort of a squirrel thing. This is a version recorded later, at the home of a man named Jean Dijk. Jean Dijk was an illustrator and animator. He directed Popeye and Tom and Jerry cartoons. But he was also an audio enthusiast and a lover of jazz and blues and folk music. Jean often hosted parties with his friend Bill Bernal at his home. They would invite some singer, usually a folk artist to her blues artist, and they would give a house concert, and she and Dich would record them, and that was a hobby of his. Connie played at one of these parties in 1954. Bill's wife remembered feeling confused by Connie, and said she was, quote, boring to look at. She described her as strange. She said, incredibly talented, obviously, um, a genius. And yet, so baffling in the way she presented herself, she described her as, uh, daudy, looking like she'd just come in from milking the cows and seemed a lufan arrogant. Later, Jean-Dyche's son, Kim, wrote about that night. He said, no one paid any particular attention to her at first. But at some point, whoever had brought Connie along, urged her to sing something, and was seeming reluctance, she did. Well, it was one of those moments who often hear about, but seldom witness. From that point on, the party was all about Connie. When I stray away from where I got to be, someone always takes me home. She played more than it does in songs that night. In the middle of one, Jean Dijk's cats started screaming. Connie said, that makes the perfect background. Our people telling her, Connie, you're really good. This stuff is great. I mean, did she have any sort of a fallow in? She had a following of people who heard her at this house concerts, and thought she was absolutely out of this world, like unlike anything they had ever heard before. So those people, yes, were telling her, you've got what it takes, you're going to be huge. Jean Dijk made copies of his recordings from the party for his friends, who would then play them for their friends. And then, Connie got an invitation to play on the morning show on CBS. Jean tried to help her prepare to be on TV. He asked her practice questions. There isn't any surviving footage of her performance on CBS. In photos, she isn't wearing her glasses. She's wearing makeup. Jean's son remembers watching her on TV and thinking, will all be bragging we knew her win pretty soon. But after her television appearance, nothing happened. No record deal. No invitations to perform on other shows. The feedback that she was getting from the music industry was, we don't know what to do with your music. And any of her papers did she write ever about feeling disillusioned about the fact that, yes, she was getting some recognition, but it wasn't enough, or she really did want to make it big, but she feared she wouldn't. I think unlike somebody like Bob Dylan, Connie Cumbers didn't play the game. She wanted to be discovered. She didn't want to go to them. She wanted them to come to her. And so I think that her main focus was composing, songwriting, performing, and then showing up for whatever opportunities presented themselves, but not going after them, per se. Sometimes musicians and singers reached out to Connie, asking to play her music. She gave one singer the exclusive right to sing one of her songs for a year, been exchanged for $50. Connie wrote to her brother every few months by guitar stuff hit some new periphery of the entertainment world. She was still writing music. She started working on an opera. In 1960, a friend of Connie's an advertising asked if she wanted to record any of her music in the studio where his company did jingles. She recorded for just a few hours, a total of 11 songs. Connie's friend told Howard that they did just a few takes of each song because she had her way of doing them pretty sad. Not long after, Connie started talking about leaving New York. She told her friends in New York that she was going on sabbatical, and that she would be back. Whether or not that was true or whether that was subterfuge is unknown. The year she left Bob Dylan came to New York and started playing in coffee houses in Connie's old neighborhood, Greenwich Village. Howard Fishman says the two effectively swapped places. Bob Dylan would become famous a few years later. Before she left New York, she wrote to a friend, I am still a printer, an aunt, and a struggling, middle-aged artist. No news on those fronts.

In 1961, Connie Converse moved Ann Arbor Michigan where her brother Phil lived. She saw him often. She gave music lessons to one of her nephews Friends of hers told Howard that if they went by Connie's house at night, they would find her playing the guitar and smoking. Her friends said they were worried about her. She was depressed. She moved into her brother's attic for a while. She protested against the Vietnam War and she became an editor for the Journal of Conflict Resolution until 1972 when the journal shut down. Connie Converse was turning 50 in August of 1974. On August 10, 1974, she dropped notes and letters into the mailbox to family and friends, each of which said different things. But several of them said, I'm going back to New York. I'm hoping to get my old job back, get in my old union, and get started again. She told her nephew, just like Bilbo Baggins, I have to go away. She wrote to her mother, it may be some time before I can get settled somewhere and get back in touch. In any event, it would be pointless for you to worry. And there was a long letter to no one in particular. In all caps, it's addressed, quote, to anyone who ever asks, if I'm long unheard from, Her brother found it in her papers later. Near the end of the letter she writes, human society fascinates me and all is me and fills me with grief and joy. I just can't find my place to plug into it. So let me go, please. And please accept my thanks for those happy times that each of you has given me over the years. And please know that I would have preferred to give you more than I ever did, or could. I am in everyone's debt. Connie Converse was never seen or heard from again. Her car, the Volkswagen, was never found. Did her family and friends that they tried to find her? What did they do? They did nothing. They did not report her missing. They did at one point talk to a private detective to see what would be involved and engaging a detective services to go looking for her. were told that every person has the legal right to disappear so that even if the detective found his sister, if his sister didn't want to be found, then the detective wouldn't be able to tell her where she is. And so for that reason, Phil said they didn't hire detective. In the United States, it's not a crime to disappear. There are no federal laws that require investigation into missing adults. If a person chooses to disappear and they're reported missing, privacy laws don't allow police to tell the missing person's family where they are, only that they're alive. As the New York Times reported in 2001, the authorities know from experience that a large majority of adults who disappear do so because they want to leave. A few weeks after Connie left, Phil wrote to a medical examiner in New York City. He said, I've lost contact with my sister, whom I believe to be somewhere in the New York City area. At the moment, I'm not completely alarmed. Her dropping out of sight was intentional and announced to me in advance. On the other hand, I know her to be despondent over several problems. So I felt I should file some identifying information with you. There were many theories in the family. Connie's cousin heard that after Connie disappeared, the back door was open, and breakfast was on the stove. The son of one of Connie's friends heard that Connie had gone off to find an old boyfriend from the Navy. Another cousin heard that Connie was on a secret assignment. One of Connie's nephews told Howard that the Michigan State police contacted him when they had found remains in Tennessee that they thought might be Connie. The detective told him he would be in touch if they could identify them, but the nephew never heard back. For a long time, Connie's recordings sat in storage. In 2004, Jean Dijk went on a radio show called Spinning on Air. He brought one of his recordings of Connie to play. It was the first time one of her songs had been on the radio. A music producer named Dan DeZula was listening to spinning on air in the car with his brother when he heard Connie's music. He said he was dumbfounded. He tried to find out more about her, but found very little. He remembered it was very frustrating. Eventually, he wrote to Gene Dijk and Phil Converse, who shared the recordings of Connie with him. Dan founded a record label and put out the first commercial release of Connie's music, called How Sad How Lovely, in 2009. Her songs have been played around 16 million times on Spotify. Today, Connie Converse is recognized as a pioneer of the singer-songwriter genre, A tribute album came out in 2017. When you start to sing her songs, you sort of connect right away to her kind of mysterious existence. This is Martha Wayne Wright. She did a cover of Connie Song one by one for the tribute album. It's my name. I was, I'm usually asked to cover the songs that are the more kind of weird or more difficult one sometimes because I, I don't know why, but in the case of Connie Convers, they're all like that. And so it's kind of fine. Hearing the song, hearing the voice, did you get a sense that this was a woman who was not trying to be anyone else? Absolutely, a complete individual. And I'm almost, sort of speaking and not so much about she was speaking about herself I suppose in a way but more about a sense of feeling out of place or not quite knowing where to be and it kind of mysticism and one put in this world and another put in another world maybe that I think really spoke to me, I sort of felt not so alone anyways. Honestly, it's very moving and I guess I do find it really personal. This is Julia Bullock. She's an opera singer. A few years ago, she started performing her own version of one by one at the end of her performances. One by one is about seeking connection in times when maybe you're feeling isolated and acknowledging that you are in communion with other people. I think given in times of great despair and sometimes I'm struck with. kind of searing emotion while singing her songs, which I guess in some ways is sort of surprising because it's not like the melody is all really demanding. But I think she found this extraordinary way to release emotion. If she were around today and you could talk to her, what would you want to talk to her about? I would just want to listen and see what I'm just sort of watch her and sort of let it happen. I'd be more curious to just hear what she had to say. I wouldn't know what to ask her because I wouldn't want to upset her or disturb her. Why this? Why that? But I think it would just be watching and listening. I'm learning. I think you just want to hang out, honestly. Cook a meal and drink some whatever she wanted to drink. Because wow, what it just extraordinarily deep and open person. And one of my favorite things about listening to that initial recording. of her and some of the other recordings that I've been sent that he also haven't been released is also just listening to her talk about her music or just these little side comments. She just seemed totally conscious and with it. And I think it just would have been very cool to be in her presence for a little while or would be very cool to be in her presence for a little while. If Connie Converse is alive, she'll turn 100 years old this year. When she was still living in the York, she wrote in a letter to her brother. For the best communication, the most satisfactory human relationship, it seems now to me that knowing and being known are prerequisites. I've always found it difficult to make myself known. I have the microphone about eight inches away and it's going way up. I'm getting a very good response. I'm going to pause a minute and try the microphone. I put the microphone down. Well, no, I can't do that. So that seems to be a good response. Howard Fishman's book is called to anyone who ever asks the life music and mystery of Connie Converse.

This is Fresh Air, I'm David B. and Coolie. Singer and actress Cynthia Arrivo has just been nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked. Here she is, singing one of that musical's most iconic songs. And you can't pull me down. Yes, I make you understand. You're having delusions of grandeur. Eyes through its setting lips. because someone says they're so. Some things I cannot change. But can I try? I'll never know. Too long I've been afraid of losing love, I guess I've lost. Well, if that's love, it comes ever much too high across. I'd sooner by defying gravity. That's Cynthia Arrival. In 2016, after coming to the US from England, Arrival starred in the Broadway revival of the musical The Color Purple, winning a Tony and drama desk award. For her starring role as Harriet Tubman in the film Harriet, she was nominated for an Oscar, and also was nominated for the movie's closing credits song, Stand Up, which she co-wrote and sang. Arivo played a Ritha Franklin in the TV mini series Genius Aritha. She also co-starred in the HBO series The Outsideer. And she released an album of song she co-wrote titled Chapter 1, Verse 1, and wrote a children's book called, Remember to Dream, Eberay. Arivo grew up in South London, where her parents emigrated from Nigeria. Terry Gross spoke with Cynthia Arivo in 2021, and asked her about playing a Ritha Franklin. They began with this scene from the mini-series Genius Auretha. This is set during Auretha's first recording session for Atlantic Records in 1967. Aurevo, as Auretha, is at the piano singing, I never loved a man the way I loved you. I don't know why I let you do these things to me I will leave you with my call Yes, I'm up time Get up, stick like this I know that I know I never know Love to me, the way that I love me It's Cynthia O'Revo from the mini series, Genius, O'Retha. Cynthia O'Revo, welcome to Fresh Air. Thank you. I had such a pleasure to have you on the show. How did you start listening to O'Retha Franklin? When I was a kid, and we were, so there's this radio station in the UK called Magic FM, and it plays everything. Everything from, let's say, I don't know if you know a band called Mike and the mechanics, to the uRhythmics, to Cape Bush, to a Reather, to Gladys Knight, Patrick LeBell, Lauren Hill, the whole lot. And so, when we were only, on the way to school, my mom would always have that radio station on, and the first time I heard it, it was from there. I think the first thing I heard was sisters are doing it for themselves. And then I heard, I think it was till you come back to me. So I had heard everything like two different ways, one with Annie Lennox, and then one on her own, from two different times. And I just sort of fell in love. I didn't really know, because I didn't know who that was. And then I started asking questions, and my mom told me, it was a wreath of Franklin. And so I was aware of how much I loved music and that I wanted to be a singer and I just sort of fell in love with her voice. The fact that she could do that with any lens and then that on her own just was astounding to me. Did you try to emulate her? I don't think I tried to emulate her. I just wanted to listen to everything she had, and I started learning how music pretty early. Yeah. I know you've said that when you were listening to Reeth before playing her, that one of the things you were listening for is where did she breathe? Oh, yeah. Why was that important? Because the breath, I think, tells you everything about what the person is trying to say. You know, if you look at a sentence, where the comma goes, tells you what the sentence means. If I say today I've been feeling really, really bad. But, and now I say today I've been feeling really bad. But I'll be all right. Well now, I feel ill and one is emotionally, I feel bad. You see? And so when she would breathe in different places and it would change the sentence structure, it would change the meaning of the song. Another person might sing it a completely different way. Can you sing us an example of what you mean? I used the song often to explain it, because it's one, it's a beautiful song, and two, I had to really, really dig in and learn it. And three, just is a wonderful example of how the breath work changes. And it's called Never Grow Old. I had to learn it for the amazing grace episode. It goes like this. The sentence is, I have heard of a land on a faraway strand. That's the sentence. The normal way to sing it is, I have heard of a land on a faraway strand. Right? She sings. have heard of a land all far far away strength You get the impression that it's more far away. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. But I'll tell you, it was beautiful both ways. She just has this way with music. The way she manipulates it and uses it to tell the story is really special. And it's that sort of making you wait for the explanation. Because when it's a difference between In moving from one note to the other really quickly, I have heard as opposed to I have heard. of an end. You know? You met her twice backstage at the color purple and at the Kennedy Center. Did you feel like you were able to have a meaningful conversation with her? I think sometimes like when you meet somebody who's so important to you, you just don't know what to say. I think that was I was that. I didn't really know what to say but I was also sort of disarmed by how funny she was. She was so like Joviel, she joked that when I first met her, she sang the last sentence of my big song back at me. And so I almost fell over because Ruth Franklin is singing and I'm here back at me. I just, I didn't know what to do. I think I just laughed. I was like, oh my god. And I remember, I remember saying, you can say, I was like, oh my god, this is nuts. I don't know if I need anything more meaningful than that to be honest because if the grain of salt can remember you as the person who can say, well, wonderful. She was brought up in the church and she was brought up singing gospel in the church on tours through the south and in her father's church. And so when she started singing R&B, it was so church-influenced. And I'm wondering about if you grew up, church did all in England and if so, what the music was like. Um, we did, I did grow up in church, um, a different, because, um, Roman Catholic is what I was raised on and then, but I was a bit of a rebel, so when I was in church, it was a lot of like question hymns and I wanted more because I was listening to gospel music and I was learning about gospel singers and I was learning about that sound and I wanted to I wanted to hear it in my own church, so one of the churches when we moved to East London from South London and that church had a choir. So I remember they asked if I could join the choir and so I did and then somehow I managed to end up being like one of the conductors of the choir and then we're just like sneak gospel songs in from time to time and just have them like sing a couple gospel songs consequently I got into trouble for it and they were like you can't you can't make single songs in here anymore and I never understood why because I felt like All music that was for the same reason was equal and was meaningful. Was the objection to the gospel music, the lyrics of the song or the style of singing? I think it's the style of singing. I think the style of singing was where the objection came. The particularly straight-laced way of praising that correct for the Catholic Church. There's a specific way that you should do it, and there's a specific thing that you can see. There are specific songs, and anything outside of the lines is too far. Was there a predominantly wide congregation? Very much, so yes. You went to Rotto, which is the rural Academy of Dramatic Arts in England. Very famous school. You didn't know what existed when you were invited to. I didn't know. I didn't know. Was it revelatory once you got there to study acting in such a formal and probably traditional way? Yeah, I just because I didn't know that that was even the possibility. When I was going through primary school or secondary school, no one was like, you can go to drama school, no one gave me that option. So the whole thing was revolutionary. Like the first year was both discovery and struggle in a half, because I just like, what am I? doing here and I saw there's so many things I don't really understand is what was my strong suit was that I was a little bit different to most people that I was one of the kids that was good at singing and we had a particularly musical year so there were a couple of other kids who could sing too and actually being able to sing was really useful and and when I started to embrace that I sort of could see where the opportunities were. Some people were really wonderful at the classics in that jacket piece and you know those kids that came from Eaton who had read those things were brilliant at those things but I wasn't that my raw talent came from understanding music. So when we started talking about some time and learning those songs for me I was in heaven and when we started reading seven guitars by August Wilson I recognized myself in those people because while it was a black writer writing about black people and I could see myself in them and those are plays I had read and those are playwrights heard of and when you were passionate about Acting Shakespeare was where we were sort of like joined hands because, well, you will new Shakespeare, but now I could have a sort of a real grasp on the scope of what she wrote. You know, when you were talking about a read that you talked about the importance of where you breathe and how it can even change the meaning of a phrase. So when you were learning sound himes to hongs, I think breath is really, especially important in those songs in terms of the meaning, but in some of the sentences in terms of having an opportunity to breathe. Because some of the songs there isn't, there isn't a lot of opportunity. And those songs are really rangey, you know, so your breath support would be really important. Is there a song you especially loved when you started singing song hi? I love being alive, and I love the militant. Have you ever had the militant? I have. I've seen you sing it on YouTube. So if anybody wants to see it, it's there. Yeah, that's one of my favorite songs. That is one of those songs where you're like, if you don't breathe in the right place, you won't make it to the end of the sentence. Can you give us an example of what you mean? Oh my god, I don't even know if I can remember the lyrics. I haven't done it for such a long time. Is it? It's a wink and a wig and a giggle and a grass and I'll trip the light-pandango of pinching a pinching a dill in the middle of a process by it's a very short run from the pinching the punch to the punch and the punch and the punch and the punch and the punch and the punch and the punch and the punch and the saw in the mean while there are girls that we kiss before now so we fed and a lot in between in the mean while and the girl has to celebrate What passes by? Oh, I shall marry the man of Son. Yeah, thank you. How did you figure out where to breathe? Did you get advice on that? Did it seem natural? I got, I got advice. I had a really lovely teacher at Raleigh. It was Philip. He was just... He was wonderful actually. I will say that in my singing teacher at Prada, we're all sort of assigned a singing teacher. Most of us, because we've never sung before. So we can learn about what that is and learn how to connect the singing voice and the singing breath with the speaking voice and the speaking breath. So we don't differentiate the two so far apart that were afraid of one of them because it's sort of one and the same. And I think that because I was already in tune with my singing voice, what Philip did with me was encourage me to try new things try more, so he would have me singing areas from or tell her. And were you comfortable singing in an operatic style or didn't not matter which style you're saying and as long as you did this. I was comfortable classical music was sort of a love of mine and then when I went to drama school my voice was already sort of ready to try that and it's the same like whilst I was doing the colour purple my singing teacher June. Joan later, rather, was wonderful. She would give me classical music or opera to sing, because she said that the best way to allow my voice to be open enough to sing what I was singing on stage was to just try something that was totally opposite to it. So you weren't taxing your voice the same way the entire time. You were just sort of opening it up and exercising it, but not stressing it. Can you give us an example of how you learn to open up your voice? I'll do one of the first things I did at secondary school actually, because we'd always do sort of like the end of year, like, choral show. And this one year we decided to do Rata Requiem, the Rata Requiem by John Rata. And I was asked to sing, there's a version of P-A-A-Soo for the genre to record. And it's very special. Who knows if I can still do these next, but I'll give it a go. P-S-O-D-M-E. Don't I use Requiem Requiem A ton of Don't I use Domini Don't I use Domini But there would change keys P, so Domini This key change is always really difficult. Oh, so beautiful. What about that open your voice? I guess there's a couple of things that are happening. Your breath is different. The way you place the way you use your tongue is different. The tongue placement is different in your mouth. It's almost like even the way you use the muscle in your face. Often to make those sounds that at your jaw has to be slightly lowered and relaxed. And after that, I don't know if you, when you watch me sing, you'll see that I sing often with a bit of a smile on. One, I'm enjoying myself, but two, when you smile, everything else is relaxed. Cynthia Orivo speaking with Terry Gross in 2021. She is currently starring in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked. We'll hear more of their interview after a break. Also, Can Tucker plays us some great new Christmas music. I'm David B. and Koolie, and this is fresh air. Your mother who raised you came from Nigeria, what were her dreams? She's a past a lot of her dream. Her dream was to be a nurse, so she got that and then had to change it. I watched her, so we'll go, okay. I got my nursing degree. And now what else do I want? I think she definitely wanted to be in the UK with her with children. I know she wanted children. I think she wanted more children than she has, but she's very happy with the two that she does. And I think that she sort of learnt after the dream of being a nurse came to you, that she had this passion for taking care of children full-stop. And so she's focused her studies on the cognitive health of children and ended up becoming, there's a position in the UK called Health Visitor. And her job specifically is to help new mothers with children from the age of, say, one month or most to the age of three. Just with learning cognitive skills and making sure that the mother isn't suffering from postpartum. And if they are, then she can help. And she makes sure that the children are latching in the right way. If there's anything going on, there's colleague, all of those things, all the things that you would, um, you might panic about if you don't have any guidance. My mother is there to help you with. That's what Hedgehog used to be. And she sort of flew with it. She got the worst of the top of the ranks on that one. Yeah. Was it reassuring to you to have a mother who knew what to do if something went wrong? Oh my gosh, yeah. Yeah, she's cool. It's really fun. I realize that she's like a child whisperer. It's really fun watching her with other people's children because they don't really know how it's done on night. I don't know how it's done. I feel like I've been, it feels like it's like in our genes because I end up being the same with kids and I don't really need to do very much. It's sort of like, oh, look, what's this? Interesting looking being sitting next to me. I want to, I want to know who that person is and that, and we're off to the race is, it's hilarious. I think she paused it on. Your parents separated, I think, when you were pretty young, and by the time you were a 16, your father told you in her sister that he was done. Well, yeah, he told me. He told me, he told me that he was our allies and I sort of had to relay the message to everyone, yeah. What was your reaction? Could you see that coming? I didn't see it coming although I in hindsight I probably should have seen it coming but I didn't see it coming because you know what 16 year old would at the time was of Hobbrook because it was in public when it happened as well so it was just like not fun but yeah it was it was deeply disappointing deeply heartbreaking and I think I felt bad for having to have to bring that information back to my house, to my mom and my sister, and I remember it was in the middle of a school day, so I still had to go through school, that was not fun. Did he give you an explanation? No, not really. No, I think he just had, I think he was finished being a dad. And did you think that there was something about you that made him leave or did you think, like, he's being mean and thoughtless and doing this and that's on him, not on me? I don't know if I was thinking about that. I never really compartmentalized it. I just saw someone doing something that hurt me. And I think it was just sort of as simple as that. Like, someone is doing something that he knew would hurt me to be meaner spiteful. But I knew that he was going to stick to it. I knew that it wasn't like a jab that he would take back at some point. Have you spoken to him since? No. Well, actually, I actually tell a lie, I bumped into him randomly at a cousin's wedding. We hadn't awkward, sort of, hello, and that was, that's it. When it was 25. I want to play another song from your new album. And this is called The Good. Do you want to say something about what you were thinking about when you wrote it? Yeah, so when I wrote it, we had gotten to a point where I knew that we needed an uptempo song, we needed something with That felt upbeat and that felt fine. But I love writing ballads. I love writing love songs. I can't help it. I'm so I'm a midtempo. Don't need to apologize. That's what I do. And I'm like, I enjoy them. I enjoy singing because of the space in them. But then, so as we started writing, what can you make this about? And my friend, who is also the EP on this album with me, he said, that he had been talking to a friend of ours about the relationship that she had with her father. She said that the relationship wasn't great all the time, but they were starting to rebuild and that they were starting to have some really good moments and then he passed away. And then she said, but she just wants to remember the good. And a light bulb went off. And I was like, that's the song. The song is about remembering the good, even when something ends, maybe not in the best of ways. Well, it's here of the song. This is the good from Cynthia Arrivo's new album, chapter one, verse one. Doesn't spring from me I can't see holding my chest as all my tears fall out. My mind's in a spin as all the pain falls down. What can I do to make these days go by? I haven't a strength to make the frame for that just want to remember. That's Cynthia or Rivo from her new album Chapter 1, verse 1. So this is kind of a personal question in terms of if that it has personal meaning for me. So your 5 foot 1, Harriet Tubman who you portrayed was even shorter, and I'm not quite 5 feet. So as a short person, I'm wondering if you think it's had much of an impact on your life or your career to be short. I don't know, because I never, I mean, the thing is, a lot of people don't realize I am as short as I do. I didn't realize it. I was reading about you and I was like, really? I mean, I spend a lot of my time in heels, but like, often when I'm with other people, they're also like dressed up or in their heels. And so when I'm standing next to them, they're like, oh my goodness, you're really small. I think there have been times often that people assume that because you're small, you are weak or because you're small. Sometimes people, they often decide that because you're small, you're also childlike, which sometimes is really strange because you have to sort of correct people and let them understand full. Actually, I'm a fully grown adult. I just happen to be small. My understanding of what you are saying or anyone else is saying is just the saying. What about chairs? Do you find a target to find a chair that fits? Yes, like chairs that are high enough to get tables and stuff. Well, you know, chairs are, like, too deep and often too high. That's a swinging posture. Is your legs right? Exactly. Yeah. That's a thing. So you end up having to, like, punch at the edge of the seat, so you'll feet can touch the ground, or podiums. podiums are hilarious, because sometimes you were also like, you know what? Today I'm just going to swallow my pride and ask them for a little step, so I can reach the podium and feel like I'm in normal height. and reach the things I'm not having to tip to, so slightly, or where 15 inch heels, that is sort of like, it's that, you have to take the good with the bad with it, that definitely. Stools, high chairs are really sometimes quite difficult, You know, if you're singing and you want to sit, you're often on a stool, so you have to try and make sure that the stool is not too high for you to sit on. And so I always make the compromise with whatever dress I'm wearing or whatever clothes because if they cover my feet, you can't see how far my feet are on the ground. If this does too high, you have to kind of shimmy onto it. You can't reach that high. Your behind doesn't reach that high. Make a little jumps to get that. And then slide that slide down. Oh my goodness. Cynthia, it's been so delightful to talk with you. Thank you so much for doing this. And just thank you for your work. Thank you. Thank you so much. This has been so much fun. You are wonderful. Thank you. Cynthia Arrivo recorded in 2021. She's currently starring in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked. The first half of the two-part adaptation opened November 22nd and already has earned more than $300 million in American ticket sales. Coming up, I'll review the new prime video series The Sticky, which brings the sensibility of the TV series Fargo to Canada's Serap Industry. This is fresh air. This is Fresh Air, I'm TV critic David B. and Coolie. The sticky is a new TV series starring Margo Martin Dale, inspired by the biggest crime in Canadian history, the theft of a massive amount of government-stored maple syrup. This new six-part prime video mini-series, all of which is streaming now, tells that story, but more whimsically than faithfully. Don't think of the sticky as a fact-based Canadian crime story. Think of it more like the movie Fargo, where half the fun is enjoying the snow-covered scenery and the somewhat cartoonish characters. And though the series creators of the sticky, Brian Donovan and Ed Harrow don't mind the French Canadian accents for laughs the way Fargo played with those Minnesota draws, the loose connection with the truth is exactly the same. The Fargo movie and TV series stated at the start that they were based on a true story, but they were lying, because why not? The opening disclaimer in the sticky is just as playful, but much more honest. It says, this is absolutely not the true story of the great Canadian maple syrup-piced. In that real-life robbery, $18 million worth of maple syrup reserves were stolen with the theft discovered in 2012. In this six-part version for TV, the heist is planned by a trio of unlikely co-conspirators. There's Remi, a local security guard, the only security guard at the place where local syrup is stockpile. Mike is a low-level mobster visiting from Chicago. And Ruth is a local farmer who taps her trees for sap each year, but whose land is about to be sold out from under her. All three of these people have grudges to settle. The security guard against the syrup federation that treats him poorly. The gangster against the mob family that takes him for granted, and the farmer whose property is being targeted by the head of the syrup association, even though her husband is in the hospital in a coma. Remi, the security guard, hatches a plan to steal some syrup. He tells the mobster, who tries to enlist Ruth because of her knowledge of the trade. Mike is played by Chris Diamantopolis. Geon Seer plays Remi, and Margo Martendale plays Ruth. You need this. So hear him out. Remi. So here's my system. It took some thinking, but it's pretty sweet. In the dark of night, I sneak a barrel out each month. The normal Celsius erupt to his guy, one province over. We just have to do that a little bit of times when we get rich. Easy peasy. Boom. Boom. Boom. What? Boom. Boom. One barrel, that's your plan. A million dollars, three ways. That's what you want. Yeah. Let's see. Okay, I thought about it for four seconds. Listen to this. The association has a barrel set price at $2,489. We sell to Ham and Eggers in Ottawa. They're going to screw us. We go 2K on the black market. Now that means, you know what that means? That means YouTube bozos have to pinch 500 barrels at night in a week. It's not just dumb. That's stupid. I gotta know this 500 barrels missing. Once the three agreed to work together, the real fun begins. Outside factors and unexpected antagonists keep coming up the works. And these three very different characters react differently at almost everything, including one or another. Ruth is the brains of the outfit. Remy knows almost nothing, and Mike certainly knows nothing about the production methods of maple syrup, which he demonstrates in a conversation with him during a cramped truck ride. Six weeks. You ate all year long for a lousy six weeks to tap syrup. Fap. What? She said sap. Four to six weeks to collect the trees sap, then we turn the sap to syrup. Is that just syrup in the trees? No. No. That would be amazing. Okay, but we're stealing the syrup, right? What is stealing sap? Of course not. How do you not know this? Because no one does Ruth. No one except sap farmers. They are not called sap farmers. The point is sugar and season's almost over. But Margo Martin Dale, who was so enjoyable to watch on both justified and the Americans, has a blast with this leading role. Her major co-stars, including Gita Miller and Suzanne Claimon, as a pair of investigators on their trail, are all Canadian actors, and all add to the mix here. but the secret ingredient and the reason to make this a must-watch TV series is an eventual substantial guest-star appearance by an American, Jamie Lee Curtis. She arrives late, but makes his big an impact as she did in her Emmy-winning guest-stint on the bear, or as the tax auditor in everything everywhere all at once. It's such a blast to see Curtis and Martin Dale swing for the fences with their portrayals, and both of them hit it out of the park. The entire company of actors is strong, and the French versions of American pop songs on the soundtrack are at delight. The best part of all is that while the sticky is loaded with wonderful characters, performances, music, and surprises, it's not at all overly sentimental, which is good. The last thing you'd want from a TV show about a maple syrup-piced is for it to be too sad. Coming up, we hear some new Christmas songs. This is Fresh Air. Each year the holiday season brings new Christmas music, and Rot critic Ken Tucker has been listening to it all to select the songs he's enjoyed the most. This year's picks include new holiday albums by Ben Folds and the Country Group Little Big Town, as well as a duet from a very famous pop star and a very famous football player. Here's Ben Folds with his new song, The Bell That Couldn't Jingle. A Christmas bell was crying Then Santa heard it say I just can't seem to jingle And I can't go on the sleigh There are two ways to go when recording Christmas music, devout or irreverent. By devout, I don't mean somberly religious as much as I mean sincere and respectful. Few pop performers do devout sincerity more assiduously than Ben Foltz, whose earnest tone is ideal for holiday songs. Folds has a new album called Slayer, as in Christmas Slay. Though I'm sure given his puckish sense of humor, he meant the title to echo the name of the thrash metal band Slayer, spelled differently, and authors of albums such as Rain in Blood. Ben Folds by contrast wants to rain in heaven, less to sing his new would-be Christmas standard called Christmas Timeline. Christmas morning in the back of the old family fort with my feet dangling wondering when they might grow to the floor. Won't give high wrapped in foil and give trapped in newspaper ringing the bell of my grandmother's door. All the memories that I've seen The sentimentality that is inherent in much country music gives it an ideal base upon which to build holiday music. And the four-member country act, Little Big Town, has now created the Christmas record, a straightforward title for a briskly sung collection that mixes standards with original material, such as their single glow. These hills, these rose, could hear some snow, let it be Christmas. You're bright, you're cheap, boxed up, all year Let it be Christmas Let's try not to miss deep inside of you, find it, let the light in you show Let it go, let it go, let it go One of the little big town's better choices of country covers is their version of a song I wish more people listen to at this time of year. Murrow Haggard's lovely song, if we make it through December. If we make it through December, everything's gonna be alright. I know it's the coolest time of winter. And I shiver with I see the falling snow If we make it through to somewhere God plays to be in a warmer town called the summer time Maybe even California If we make it through to somewhere we'll be fine My final selection of new Christmas music is a duet between a very famous pop star and a very famous football player. No, no, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey have not cut their version of Grandma got run over by a reindeer. I'm talking about Travis' brother Jason Kelsey, and his duet with Stephen X, doing Ron Sech Smith's beautiful holiday song, maybe this Christmas. Maybe this Christmas will meet something more Maybe this year, love will appear And maybe forgiveness will have to call someone with love, someone with lost, for reasons we can't quite recall. Maybe this Christmas That surprisingly effective Kelsey Stevie Dewette is part of an album called a Philly Special Christmas Party, a Philadelphia Eagles Charity fundraiser. Thinking back to the start of this review, all of my new examples are devout, not irreverent. Maybe next year, someone will come up with a new novelty Christmas hit. But as it stands, this year is well served by some very soothing music.

        "full_text": " We hold these truths to be self-evident, but all men are clean. There's a number of corners I get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office. Experts on what they're talking about. This is the podcast. Insights into the issues. China, bioterrorism, Medicare for All, in-depth discussions, breaking it down into simple terms. We hold these truths. We hold these truths. We hold these truths with Dan Crenshaw. Welcome back everybody we were returning to hold these truths your favorite podcasts and you're going to even five stars because it's favorite podcast and we we've got a repeat of thunder here we've got Dr Scott Gottlieb he's the former FDA commissioner on our under president Trump. Currently at a I fellow member of National Academy of Medicine. sort of previous sense that the Department of Health and Human Services of Professor at New York University School of Medicine. Since the last time we spoke, we spoke it a couple times that the first time we made remember Dr. Gottlieb, he was all over the news during the year 2020 talking about COVID. He was one of those, I think, familiar faces that people looked to for just to just get some balanced and takes on the information that everybody was receiving at a rapid fire rate. He's been working on a new book recently called the Miracle Century, making sense of self therapy revolution. This is something we take an interest in on the healthcare subcommittee on energy and commerce. It's going to be nerdy, but I think there's going to be some interesting takeaways what self therapy is and how it can help our future generations. And you know, help by helping, I mean, ranging a range of diseases from Alzheimer's to heart damage to cancer, maybe even reverse the effects of aging. And then we can all be vampires. But I'll stop there. There's a lot to say more about his bio. Scott, thanks for being on. Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me. So, I mean, let's just start with the bullet. It's not out yet, but why sell therapies? You could write a book about a number of things, I'm sure. I don't know what your, I should know this, but I forgot. What's your, what did you specialize in as just in the medical field? And then that really took this book at all? Yeah, general internal medicine, and I practiced as a hospitalist taking care of patients inside the hospital inside the intensive care unit. Coming up at the FDA, so I was at FDA from 2017 to 2019. And when it was there, we approved the first gene therapies. We approved three of them at that time. One was a treatment for pediatric form of leukemia. We also approved a gene therapy for a treatment treatment for an inherited form of blindness. And what I was seeing with respect to not just what we were able to prove over that time period, but what was in the pipeline was the transformative potential of these new modalities of cell and gene therapy more broadly. And that's why I wanted to write a book focusing on the development of this technology. If you think about what we do in medicine and what I do as a hospitalist, a lot of what we do when we prescribe medications is treat the symptoms of disease and sometimes we're fortunate enough to be able to slow the progression of a disease. There's very few places in clinical medicine. We can actually prescribe a therapy to cure a disease. Outside of oncology, certain forms of cancer, that you can cure, there's cure of therapy available for certain forms of cancer. And outside of infectious diseases, we can treat an infection, for example, with antibiotics and cure the infection. Most of what we do in medicine is prescribe drugs that treat the symptoms of disease and in some cases hopefully slow the progression of the disease and surgery can potentially cure the disease. But not necessarily in medicine and internal medicine to the field that I practice in and what cell and gene therapy offers. really for the first time on a broad basis is the ability to reverse the effects of disease and in some cases develop a fundamental cure for disease and we're already seeing that with some of the therapies that have been improved and the pipeline is very full right now. So I think this is going to fundamentally transform medicine and we're just at the early stages of it and that's why I want to focus on it. So I mean, one kind of self-therapy, do I think most people are familiar with is stem cell therapy, but I have no idea. There are no works or not. I think there's a lot more clinical data than it needs to happen. And it's unclear what it's useful for and what it isn't. Some people take it up to different types of cell therapies or stem cell therapies, sometimes they take out a fat, reproduce it. that's considered a more high quality one. And in other cases, they literally just, you take it out of maybe your marrow or your fat and just re-inject it into your joints and then, you know, maybe your joints feel better. It's kind of unclear. What's your general take on that? And then what else do we mean by cell therapies? Beyond just that, again, this sort of, I think, what would I call it? Yeah, this fat of stem cells. Yeah, that was a pretty good overview, just laid out of the different, the different modalities, if you're well of cell therapies. So you talked about taking cells out of the bone marrow, that's generally played with rich plasma, which a lot of orthopedic surgeons are using to inject into joints to try to rejuvenate joints. Then you talked about it at a post stem cells. Those would be used also in orthopedic procedures, and also some cosmetic surgery. The real breakthrough, I think, came in 2006. when we develop the technology to create what we call induced plated potent stem cells. And that's basically the ability to take an adult cell so a cell that you might derive from a person's own body and basically turn back the clock on it, turn it back into a stem cell so take a finished adult cell and turn it back into its sort of promoterial, you know, original state, a stem cell that can then be induced to form other kinds of tissue. And so a lot of the treatments that are being put into development right now are based on induced boy protein stem cells. So those those kinds of modalities when you talk about stem cells and induced play protein stem cells and even adipose stem cells a lot of that falls within the rubric broadly speaking of regenerative medicine trying to use stem cells to restore tissue that may have become damaged or destroyed as a result of disease or injury. The other cell therapies that are in development And that's when I focus on very heavily in the book are the ability to take immune cells like T cells and re-engineer them and use them as targeted therapies or to take blood cells and re-engineer them to help cure diseases like sickle cell disease or hemophilia so that's a whole other field where we're able to by manipulating the DNA of blood cells re-engineer blood cells either to treat diseases or in some cases when you're dealing with disease where the underlying dysfunction is in the blood cell itself. It's blood cell itself, try to cure the disease. And we just saw a treatment get approved for sickle cell disease, which was a gene therapy delivered to blood cells. We saw one recently approved for hemophilia as well in another blood disease. How on earth do you manipulate cells DNA? I mean, we sort of, we talked about that in modern parlance, like it's something like, oh yeah, I mean, just you just manipulate the, you just read the DNA. Nobody has any clue how to do that, though, of course. So, are you injecting it with some kind of specific chemical or combination of proteins? I would even get those proteins up. I'd like to explain things to people just from the very basics if it's even possible. Yeah, one of the things that I did with this book was talk about the early, so I focused a lot on the development of CAR-T therapy. This is a form of immunotherapy being used to treat different forms of cancer, particularly blood cancers, where it's defined as basically taking T cells. And as you said, manipulate the DNA to get the T cell to express a new receptor that can recognize the cancer cells. And so you take these T cells out, you re-engineer them with new receptors, where you basically train them how to recognize the cancer, and then you expand them and re-enject them in large quantities. And when they get re-infused into the same patient that they were taken from now with this new receptor that they're expressing, they go on to attack the blood cancer cells. The technology for trying to re-engineer manipulate the DNA of T cells really started in probably the early 1980s with research coming out of Stanford and MIT. where scientists figured out how to use viruses, and particularly retro viruses, basically like HIV, HIV is the retro virus, to re-engineer the virus itself and take the harmful features out of the virus. But maintain the aptitude that viruses had to keep a building. But that's exactly how did they re-engineer it? Did they mix it like that they mix it with some other chemical a thousand times until they figured out, okay, what do you do it this way? Actually, re-engineers and has the effect that we want to have. Is that somewhat accurate or do I want to do what I'm not? With the virus itself, they use laboratory techniques to splice out components of the viruses RNA. This was the RNA in the virus because viruses expressed RNA in the DNA. And so take out certain genes and then reinsert other genes in the virus that gave it these new features and then use the virus as sort of a Trojan horse to then inject that genetic material into human cells. And so what viruses do, if you think about HIV, what HIV does when infects our cells is it injects its own genetic material into our cells, which then triving our cells to make new copies of the virus. So they basically hijack our cells. And so if you can use that aptitude of the virus, the ability to hijack a cell and inject new cells. But it kind of makes it like your performing surgery on a single cell. That's a good way to think about it. And they're kind of literally like poking out the RNA, they don't like and somehow putting in the RNA, they do like and it's just, I mean, I don't want to dig too much deeper into this. I'm just curious, but it's just amazing what we've been able to do for, I don't even know of our TV's turn on. So I mean, hi, you know, this is, this is, we don't know how much of anything gets done. But it's fascinating. So those are other couple different types of cell therapies. And I think we crossed over in that conversation into what you would call gene therapies that also, right, because you were just talking about splicing out RNAs and DNAs. When you think about how cell therapies, a lot of this cell therapies that I'm focusing on, a lot of this cell therapies that you see being improved, where what you're doing is manipulating the genes in a blood cell. So you're extracting a blood cell from a person or an immune cell, a B cell or a T cell, manipulating the DNA of the cell to give it new features, and then reinserting that same cell into the patient. That's really a form of gene therapy because the gene modification you're making isn't directly on the patient, it's on their blood cells. And so you're extracting their blood cells, modifying them and then reinserting them. There's other forms of gene therapy where what you're delivering to the patient isn't necessarily a modified cell, what you're delivering is the vector itself. So you're delivering the virus directly to the patient into some tissue, some organ in the patient, and then hoping that that virus will then deliver the new genetic material into the right cells. And so when you think about it, talk about a gene therapy that treats an inherited form of blindness, In that case, what you're doing is literally injecting the virus particles that have been modified to insert this new gene directly into the patient's eye. So some of these gene therapies you might insert the virus directly into a patient's liver or their pancreas if you wanted to try to treat diabetes or try to treat certain diseases that manifests themselves in the liver tissue. So those are, you know, those are two different forms of gene therapy. I think of the manipulation blood cells, like cartit therapy, which is what I write a lot about, is sort of an exogenous dysploma of gene therapy. You're doing the gene manipulation outside the body in a person's blood cells, in a laboratory setting, and then endogenous forms of gene therapy, what you're delivering is the viral vector to deliver the gene modification directly into the patient's tissue. And for those T-cell therapies, is that related to cancer treatments, mostly? Or just a lot of things. So both originally the CAR T therapies were approved with a treatment of different forms of blood cancer. Now what we're finding is some of these CAR T therapies that are effective at treating blood cancer. They're also potentially effective at treating autoimmune diseases. So there are some trials going on looking at CAR T therapy. And for example, Lupus, we're seeing some really profound Early results. None of them approved approved yet for those indications, but there's really encouraging clinical data. And the belief is what the CAR-T therapies do is really, so this CAR-T therapy, and particularly what it does is wipe out a patient's B cells, and so if a patient has a cancer that arises in the B cells by delivering this card to therapy, which targets an antigen found in the surface of B cells called CD-19, you're able to basically oblate or wipe out all of the person's B cells, both their healthy ones as well as the cancerous ones. And that's how you cure the cancer. But what we've also found is by wiping out the B cells using these card to their B cells. What we think happens is you reset a person's immune system, and so for certain patients who have autoimmune disease, you can effectively extinguish the autoimmune disease and we've seen that in very small albeit early clinical trials but very profound results in in a group of patients. So would it be safe to say that if you if there is a cure for cancer on the horizon it's probably going to be in the form of some kind of gene therapy. Is that a is that a assumption that you might make at this point or at least some cancers. But we see you know Because of all the progress that's been underway for many years, we've seen a lot of what I would call cure us for cancer being developed and approved by the agency, including CAR-T therapies. In some patients, so the particular CAR-T therapy that was approved when I first joined FDA in 2017, cured cert patients who had acute lymphoblacic leukemia, which is a form of cancer that affects blood cancer, that affects a lot of young patients to pediatric form of blood cancer, typically Some patients who got the therapy didn't benefit from it, but there were a number of patients and contained to be a number of patients who fail other therapies that are available, fail conventional conventional, conventional chemotherapy, and can be cured by this carty therapy. So I think we're going to see that more and more where these cell therapies are so effective. and so precise in their ability to target cancer that you're going to see more cancers, able to be cured and really the holy grail right now. We've been good at designing these cell therapies to treat blood cancers. What we haven't been able to do yet in a really reliable fashion is use these cell therapies to also target solid tumors. And you're seeing now Better methods for doing that. It's going to take some regulatory innovation on a part of FDA, but also take some scientific innovation because the platforms for doing that are different than what we've done in the past, but you're seeing some encouraging results and clinical trials with these car key therapies and now being trained on solid tumors. There was some data out about 12 months ago looking at a car key therapy and treatment of pancreatic cancer, which as you know is a typically deadly form of cancer. So I mean, if you sum this up and layman's terms, you're always, correct me if I'm wrong. And every single one of these cases, you're using the patient's own cells. And then you're putting them through some kind of modification, the kind of modifications that you've already described. I'm like, I'm trying to repeat them. And then you re-inject that into the body. And so it's a very personalized form of treatment in that sense. Is that always the case you're doing sometimes use other cells from somebody else? Yeah, you can use other cells and there's treatments and development that are sort of off the shelf forms of cells. And the virtue there is that if you can develop an off the shelf preparation of cells, it's something that you could manufacture on a large scale and stockpile, you know, store in a pharmacy rather than having a personalized as treatment, as you said, for every individual patient, take on their patients, own cells out, manipulate them, expand them and re-infuse them, you can understand. how difficult and costly of a manufacturing process that is, and it adds to the high cost of the therapies. The advantage of using someone's own cells, though, is that they're not going to be recognized as foreign. I do think it's, we'll take it step back sometimes, looking at these therapies, thinking like all of these steps and research and innovation and breakthroughs that had to happen to get to this point. I mean, to even recognize that some diseases are related to your genetic makeup. So going back to the human genome project and the necessity to map out everyone's genetics and then understand how to do surgery on a DNA, which I still really don't understand. I just can't conceptualize what you're saying, and then I don't know. Like with a scout like with a really tiny scalpel, I mean, what do you even talk about? Or there's just so many steps and I think it's always good for people to take a step back and show a little gratitude for the kind of modern lives that we live where people have taken these little baby steps over the course of hundreds of years to get to this point where you can literally edit genes and save you from a disease that would have killed you just like that and then you would have no idea why even just a few decades ago. That's kind of interesting. Look, I think that's a key point here, and that's the point I tried to make in the book by looking back over this history. If you look at the history of the development of the first car team there, so I mentioned that the first car team there, where it was approved in 2017 for the treatment of this pediatric former who came to me. If you look at the drug, the drug was called Kimory, if you look at the history that led to the development of that drug, it really stretched back 30 years. The first recognition that T-cells could be effective in targeting cancer was made probably in the 1970s. through research that came out of studies with bone marrow transplants, where scientists realized that when patients with cancer receive bone marrow transplants, in cases where the bone marrow wasn't a perfect match for that patient, those patients actually were more likely to be cured for the cancer and so what they discovered was that there was a therapeutic effect from the marrow itself. There was something called graph versus tumor effects. So the marrow was attacking the tumor. And so was stimulating and immune response against the cancer that the patient had. And then they isolated the cells in the marrow that was responsible for that immun attack and it turned out to be the T cells. And so then the science scientist realized, okay, T cells can be effective. at targeting cancer cells, how could we harness this ability? And that's where the idea came for trying to take T-cells and re-engineer them to train them how to target specific kinds of cancer. So that journey that I just described was literally a 30-year journey, whether they were these small incremental insights that scientists were making along the way. And in new capabilities that they were acquiring, like the ability to use retroviruses that delivered genes or figuring out how to manipulate genes themselves in cells that ultimately lead to the first approved therapies. Yeah, it's, and you know, that story applies to most modern amenities that we have, whether it's an healthcare or, you know, this computer screen that we're using to chat with each other, the speed of light. So, We'll talk about regulation for a little bit. This is a little wonky, but it does serve right into to what I do up here. We're always trying to figure out how we can be more innovative or I guess more conducive to innovation at the FDA and by committee oversees the FDA. But it's hard for us to find a lot of easy buttons to say, like, let's just do things right and awesome. It's that's hard to find at least from the legislative perspective. You laid out two different scenarios earlier, which I thought would be a good starting point for this conversation, which was in one case, you're taking my own cells, you're manipulating them a little bit. And there was a question of what is a little bit and what is a lot of bit. That's important for how we talk about this. And then in another case, you know, you're maybe you're taking just general cells and you're creating a drug, but you can put on a shelf as much before. It's just more efficient that way. But those are two very different things. And one case, you got in your, it seems to me like you're talking about like a bone marrow transplant. Or even just a, is that I guess I don't know about bone marrow transplants to make that analogy, but we're talking about my own cells, somewhat manipulated back into my body. In other case, talking about somebody else's cells, so it sounds a lot more like a drug. Whether it's a good analogy for the first scenario where it's your own cells yet. Right, because it is your own cells. I'm not crazy. I haven't done one before, so I felt myself talking about out of turn. That's probably a good thing. I've been a patient a lot and thankfully not for that. Okay, so now there's a real question at FDA over how that should be regulated and because you've got all this really neat innovation and Um, you know, for, it can, it can take, I don't know. You tell me, like, how long is it taking for some of these, uh, a gene and cell therapies that could potentially save lives, change the world? How long is it taking to get them approved? Do we have the right way to approve them or are we thinking about them too much like a drug? Uh, I dealt with this because, you know, in one of my own constituents does this, the stem cell therapy that we were talking about and they, and they take it from your fat. And they spin it around a centrifuge, extract a stem cells, and then get the stem cells to kind of grow on the ground, so you reproduce your own stem cells, then you can re-inject those at a later date. It doesn't, there's, there's not a whole lot of other manipulation they're going on, and yet it is treated as I understand it like a like a whole new drug application. And then just for my non-doctor side, you know, common sense standpoint that seems a little out of touch, but what's your take on that? Well, if you touched on the right principle, so if you talk about the off-the-shelf cell preparations, in most cases, those are going to be, I can't think of a scenario where it's sort of an off-the-shelf preparation of cells that have been engineered aren't going to be a drug. But when you're talking about cells, we are extracting a cells from the patient, doing some form of manipulation to the cells, and then re-infusing them into the same patient, and potentially in the same spot where you extract the cells, It's the question of when that cross is over into becoming a drug, isn't always clear to everyone. The way it's defined in regulation is the cell that's extracted from the patient is more than what we call minimally, and it'd be a manipulated excuse me, then it becomes a drug. And so the question is what is more than minimally manipulated means? If you're the way I think about in the way I describe it is, if you're changing the characteristics of that cell, if you're doing something to the cell where you're changing the behavior of the cell, so that it behaves in a new way once it's reinserted into the patient, that is a general way to think about what is more than minimal manipulation. So it might be changing the physical characteristics of the cell. It might be adding drugs to the cell to change how it behaves. It might be changing the genes of the cell. That's certainly more than minimal manipulation. But there are these things that fall close to the line. And I think that's where a lot of the debate is. And it sounds like you might be describing one of those circumstances with your Um, constituent. So, for example, if you extract adipose stem cells, uh, and you might reinsert them to try to, um, treat an orthopedic injury, or to have a cosmetic effect. If you're taking the cells, extracting the cells into patient and spinning them down, so you concentrate them and infusing that preparation. That might be more than minimal manipulation that sense that you're changing the characteristics of the cell because you're taking it out of its original scaffolding and that will change the characteristics of the cell. But not in a very significant way. And so that might be one of these sort of online kinds of questions about whether or not it crosses a line and becomes more than minimally manipulated. And these are kind of the gray area of questions where I think sponsors You know, have to come into the FDA ask for permission in certain cases. It could be frustrating for them because they don't feel like they're getting back a timely answer. When I was at FDA what we tried to do was carve out certain of these what we considered low risk circumstances. So, you know, exactly the way described a situation where someone may be taking adipose stem cells, a cause and train them. So it's probably more than minimal manipulation because they're changing certain characteristics of the cell by taking it out of its usual scaffolding. By using it in a low risk way, like a like a dermal procedure or like an orthopedic procedure. So we explicitly carve that out and we said, look, this may be more than minimal manipulation. But for purposes of regulation, we consider it a low risk use of cells, as long as you follow good manufacturing standards, you do it under sterile technique. There's not a lot of risk to the patient. So we're going to choose not to regulate that. We're exercising enforcement discretion. And I think that's where the agency can lean forward a little bit more and describe some of more of these sort of low risk circumstances, where it's chooses not to regulate So that it could focus its activity on the higher risk circumstances, where there's more potential risk to patients that are being introduced by some of these therapies. Yeah, I mean, it gets to this uncertainty of on the regulatory side and I think a lot of the private sector feels like it's done enough consistency to have these decisions are made, whether that that that discretion is is given or whether it's not or whether they place them under a different pathway that is just far more cumbersome and therefore far more expensive and I've seen other cases too, where it just seemed kind of obvious that the reviewer in charge just wasn't the right person to assess that particular technology. They just didn't have the background. And so what do they default to? They default to know, and to know again, and to another trial here and another trial there, and next thing you know, you're the round of of fundraising for your company, which is about to go broke, and then we'll never have that technology again. So that balance is extremely important. The biggest challenge that I saw when I was at the agency, I think it persists. There's certainly challenges on the clinical portion of the review where you're trying to demonstrate that a product is safe and effective for its intended use. So you're running clinical trials to try to generate clinical data You know, and there's always questions about what is the bar? How much of a therapeutic benefit do you need to demonstrate? How many patients is that going to require? Especially when you're dealing with these very expensive modalities like cell therapies, those trials can get hugely expensive. It's putting a single patient in a clinical trial for a car key therapy can literally cost a million dollars. And so, you know, if you're rolling a hundred patients a restaurant, a thousand patients, that's a pretty big delta. If it's a million dollars for every patient, it gets enrolled. But the bigger sort of bucket of uncertainty in my view was around the manufacturing issues, where I think it was very hard for the FDA and still as hard for the FDA to recruit retain people who have expertise in how these products are manufactured and understanding all the complexity involved in that and also understanding how small changes in manufacturing where you might be trying to change your manufacturing process to get a better yield of these cells or be able to scale it up more quickly or make it less expensive. How all those little changes are going to translate potentially into changes in how this cells perform. And so because the agency doesn't have a lot of expertise in that, and there isn't a lot of expertise in that because it's such a new science, what ends up happening is when these sponsors want to make slight modifications in how they manufacture these cells, which is very important to try and scale it up in a way that you can actually turn it into a therapy that can be commercialized And in many cases, FDA is going back and asking them to reproduce some of the clinical data to be able to demonstrate that the cells, the characteristics of the cells, haven't changed in a way that's changing their safety and their efficacy. And that's where I think a lot of sponsors are getting stuck. And that's where a lot of the cost of being added. And that's where we need, I think, need to focus more regulatory policy making to make that process itself more efficient. This is the problem with a lot of early technologies. We have a brand new platform. I remember back in the early 2000s when antibody drugs were coming onto the market. They encountered some of these same complexities where the FDA really didn't understand how changes and how those antibody drugs were being made translated into changes and how they performed clinically. And so I asked sponsors to go back, ask companies to go back and do a lot of new clinical trials every time they made a change in the manufacturing. And it was an impediment So getting a lot of those products scaled up and on the market as well. Now we have the tools to do that. So you don't need to replicate clinical trials to prove that one antibody is exactly the same as another one, even though the manufacturing process might have changed. And we feel so certain about our ability to determine that that now we're approving generic forms of antibody drugs without requiring large new clinical trials every time. Um, just that aggressive. What is that technology that changed just do is laboratory technology, your laboratory technology technology. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's, it's a lot of, um, applied technology. So things like, you know, met, mess, back a tool for looking at protein drugs, looking at it. Everybody's being able to determine just based on the physical characteristics that this antibody is going to perform exactly the same as that antibody. So now we're able to compute by looking at the structure of the antibody, how it's going to behave. So it leads to a policy point though, because you said there isn't sort of a magic bullet in many times policy making in this realm isn't satisfying in the sense that there's not one thing you can change, and that's suddenly going to unlock the whole system. It's a lot of small modifications to the regulatory process that it's made over years by Congress. gets accrued and eventually consolidates into new ways of doing things. But I think where we could make a big dent into some of these uncertainties that we're talking about is investing more in that applied science for answering these regulatory questions. And that's not something NIH does typically. It's not something that companies do because they can't own the intellectual property around that. There's not a profit to be had in that. And so it's really this sort of barren landscape, if you will, where no one's really focused on the applied technologies. to do things like be able to demonstrate that one sells exactly the same as the other for regulatory decision making purposes. And this is some place where I think NIH could be focusing more of its resources. You know, NIH is looking at getting more into drug development, make want to be engaged in some of the sexier aspects of the sort of scientific enterprise, but the supplied science is really a gap where I think they can be focusing more attention. It's interesting. I mean, they have plenty of money. I don't think they need more money. I think they get more money every year. And they have a lot of grant programs. You would think that they could invest a little bit on that. And by applied sciences, again, so what we mean is, is the kind of technology that allows you to sort of replace a clinical trial, which is actually extremely, exactly. a new way to measure clinical benefit using a laboratory tool or think of like Alzheimer's disease, if we could figure out how to use MRI and functional imaging to assess patients and diagnose when they have Alzheimer's and how it's progressing rather than requiring clinical trials where you're measuring a patient's physical performance on many mental status tests, which takes a long time, and by the time you see changes in that, there has been a lot of disability that's accrued to that patient. So if you can measure, you know, decline of function more quickly using the imaging, that would help accelerate clinical development of the upstream of Alzheimer's. But we don't, we haven't validated those tools in a way that regulators would rely on it. That's something that, you know, NIH does do some of this. So I don't want to say they're not doing it, but I think it's someplace where we could be focusing a lot more resources on validating some of these laboratory tools. The speaking of prices, I mean, you mentioned a million dollars per patient for some doses. So I mean, that's our definite clinical trials, but that also makes me assume that if that were approved as a therapy, that's still a million dollars per dose. But is it at least, is it a one time dose that we're talking about? Or is it, I mean, these things are really expensive. And yeah, the first question is why is it like is it just the technology in a amount of labor and personnel that's required to do it or and then then how on earth do we pay for this? Well, so we find these these breakthroughs. Yeah, so the million dollars per patient that I was referring to was the cost of a single patient in a clinical trial with something like a car key therapy. But you're right, these, some of these gene therapies that have been improved have been priced at more than a million dollars. It's been multimillion dollar gene therapies. Typically, these are some of these are administered as a single dose, so maybe just a few doses. You know, the challenge is going to be paying for these, especially in our steer insurance schemes. And so what we've seen is very differential access in the marketplace where patients who have better insurance, private market insurance, have had more timely access to some of these therapies when they've been approved. And people who are in more steer insurance schemes and particularly Medicaid have not had timely access. Those insurance schemes have been much slower getting coverage in place. And when you're dealing with a gene therapy or a cell therapy, like a cartet therapy, that is literally curative or potentially curative for patients, or helps arrest the disease like the Shane's muscular dystrophy where patients accrue disability very rapidly, young patients who are born with these inherited diseases accrue disability very rapidly. The timeliness of access can literally be the difference between life and death or a life-lived with disability and one lived, you know, less encumbered by disease. And so, you know, this is going to be, I think, a big challenge for us. Why do they cost so much? Part of the reason is that they just cost a lot to make. So the cost of goods is very high if you think of a small molecule of pill drug, they might cost pennies to make that drug, or maybe dollars to make that drug. You know, if you're charging a hundred thousand dollars for the drug of fifty thousand dollars for the drug a lot of that's profit because the drug didn't cost much to manufacture with some of these cell therapies literally a manufacturing process can be tensed if not hundreds of thousands of dollars so the cost of goods is very high and what we've seen in this space and you know you have seen venture capital sort of pull away from these These areas is because the returns haven't been that good. If you're looking at sort of relative investments and different kinds of drug modalities and different kinds of opportunities, while these therapies are hugely exciting from a clinical standpoint and have the ability to cure disease, they're typically targeting very small diseases. Some cases rare diseases And so you're not going to be prescribing them to a lot of patients. The cost of developing a manufacturing, it's very high. And so companies that have invested in these spaces have not had good returns and a lot of them have curtailed some of their programs. And so that's been one of the unfortunate things. I think it's changing now because the opportunity sets getting larger. But if you look back over the last maybe five years, a lot of the the big drug companies and the venture capital firms that were investing in cell and gene therapies pulled back for a period of time. If you see any effects from the the inflation reduction acts legislation, you know, within that legislation was the the requirement for Medicare to negotiate. With with with new therapies, new drugs, there's some exceptions. And they don't know if these cell and gene therapies would fall into those exceptions. But it's a requirement to negotiate at the price that Medicare wants to set for you. And there's a pretty large punishment if you don't take that negotiation, being a 95% tax on your revenue. So if you've seen that affect the market and the venture capital, and especially the investment space. Yeah, not directly with the salging therapies. I mean, indirectly and so far as there has been a reduction in R&D budgets across the industry as a result of the IRA, but where I've seen that the IRA have a more direct impact is biasing investment away from small molecules, because the negotiation gets implemented sooner for small molecules versus biologicals like antibody drugs or even these cell therapies. You are seeing companies pull away from investment in small molecule, pill form drugs, particularly small molecules that treat drugs where it's going to be heavily reimbursed by Medicare. So drugs for the treatment of conditions that would affect older individuals. There's definitely been a reallocation of capital. And you see that in the deals that are getting done in the pharmaceutical industry. So the thing that's going to get affected first is the deal making. We're a company's placing new investments. And they're now shifting investment towards large molecules antibody-based drugs because those come under the price negotiation later than the small molecule drugs. And so they have sort of free from the price controls for a long period of time. And that's unfortunate because there's certain diseases and certain targets, biological targets, that can only be addressed with small molecules. If you're thinking about trying to target something inside itself, so an intracellular target, if you're thinking about trying to target something in the brain that has to cross the blood-brain barrier, small molecules are a very efficient way to do that. When we're talking about large molecules, biologicals like antibody drugs, Typically, they only target things on this surface of a cell. They can't get it in cell. And so there's whole diseases and whole areas of biological targets that can only be addressed with small molecules. And that's a real concern. I think a lot of us have a concern that now there's going to be less investment in those areas, and we're already seeing it. So the small molecules always mean pill form, or can that also mean of cell engine therapies? We're just talking about it. Yeah, so the, so the selling gene therapies would are biologics and so they would be considered large molecules. Small molecules are generally pill form drugs, but some of them are also infused. They were small molecule drugs that are infused or injected. You know, the glip ones, the drugs that are being used for weight reduction are peptides. So they're an injected drug, but they're considered a small molecule drug. So they're subject to the IRA price negotiation in that short of time frame. In fact, we're govy. One of the drugs that I'm a glue tie is going to be subject to the price negotiation next year. So small molecules can be injected drugs, but they're typically swallowed as pills. I wonder too, and again, there's no way to know this because we don't have access to the multiverse. And we can't see what history would have been without some particular lobbying pass. But because there's still a timeline when they're subject to that negotiation to these companies. Again, it's hard to know. I don't think they would announce it, but they clearly have an incentive to have a higher price from the get-go. if they know they're going to get hammered by by medic by CMS at a certain later date, or you're seeing that at all. Yeah, the market's competitive. So it's hard. There's a lot of downward pressure on pricing right now. And if you look at inflation in the drug sector, last year was the first year that prices overall fell. And I don't, I don't want to attribute that to the IRA. I just attribute it to the competitive pressures in the marketplace exerted by PM's. and insurers. And so it's hard to say what what would have been. I think where it's easier to see an effect. I mean, you can certainly, there's certainly an argument to be made that as we introduce more price controls in the marketplace. And the IRA, certainly a price control. It creates incentives to try to launch at higher, higher list prices because you know your price is going to be driven down by the various price controls that are in the marketplace. You're going to have a shorter window to recoup. That's what I mean. Yeah. Well, right. See the most immediate impact, though, is just the flows of capital and what companies are choosing to invest in. And, you know, companies aren't abandoning programs that they had. So you're not going to just shut down a program that's in later stages of development because of the IRA. Right. But you're not going to be putting new capital in those areas. And once companies get out of the, um, the scientific know-how of developing small molecule drugs. So once they get rid of what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, They're not going to just get back into it. They're going to use the expertise and to know how for doing that. What diseases should we be? Should we be most worried about in this space? Because I'm not a, despite all my knowledge on this, I don't know which diseases are likely to be treated with small molecule of drugs. So what is that? What might not get that investment? And so, you know, one area that I flagged is mental health diseases where a lot of the targets are intracellular targets and so can only be addressed with small molecules and infectious diseases, things that we have to treat inside the brain. Yeah, if you're trying to address it with a small molecule, I mean, some of the drugs that are coming onto the market are biologicals that are being used to target brain disease. It is like Alzheimer's as well, neurodegenerative diseases, but a lot of you are small molecules. So, anything like that, anytime you're trying to get inside a cell to target some receptor inside the cell, it could be cardiovascular drugs as well in certain drugs you've used in primary care. The mental health disease is one big area that I worry about because a lot of those are intracellular targets that would typically be addressed with small molecules. You worked a lot with European counterparts, I don't know what the FDA is called in Europe, but there's pros and cons to it and I just got back from London and intelligence committee trips of nothing to do with healthcare, but their politics are old riled up is just as they are in every country all the time just like they're here and uh... one of the biggest issues there is an hs their national health service and uh... you know which is it apparently in disarray fallen apart and there's months and months of way times for whatever it is you need I don't know. I don't know if there's a question in there, but maybe I'm looking for a comment. And what are the pros and cons of our system? I do know that sometimes it's easier for innovators to go to Europe. I've heard from the private sector that sometimes they just have an easier time dealing with European regulators, in some instances. At the same time, I think America's by far, number one, when it comes to innovation and anything with respect to healthcare. So, talk to me about that. What should we worry of when we look at the continuing downfall of NHS and also what you see in Canada, what is effectively a single payer system? I'm not quite like NHS, but give us your thoughts on that if you don't want. Yeah, look, I think that the European, the MA, the European regulators for a number of years were leaning forward a little bit more on the approval of treatments for significant unmetical diseases, particularly orphaned diseases, inherited diseases that affected pediatric populations. I think so there was a gap between FDA and EMA in terms of You know, how permissive they were willing to be when it came to the approval of novel therapies that treated very serious unmet diseases with a weren't good available therapy. I think a lot of that gaps been closed. I think 20% recurs and implementation of it. As closed a lot of that gap, and that FDA has adopted some of the same approaches that the Europeans have. I don't think that the European regulates I would argue that they're more flexible now. I mean, there may be certain pockets of certain therapeutics, certain therapeutic categories where they might have a certain different focus than the FDA and perhaps are a little bit more accommodating. But I think overall, at worst the regulatory authorities are comparable and I would argue and I worked at FDA so I'm going to defend the agency to some degree but I would argue I think FDA is a more accommodating agency overall with respect to Europe though these new products just aren't getting paid for and in more and more cases you see companies just not launch them in Europe or launch them much later in Europe And, you know, particularly when you're dealing with products that are this potentially transformative in terms of the therapeutic effect that delivery. And that's going to start to translate itself into differences and outcomes. And you saw for years, and I wrote about this a number of years ago, you saw a real divide in cancer outcomes between the US and UK. And while it's hard to prescribe exactly what that's attributable to. You know, a lot of it's some of it's early diagnosis and different differences in diets and environment. But certainly some of it was attributed to the fact that there was this whole spade of drug approvals in 2000s and sort of in 2000s that were really transformative. And they weren't approved as quickly in the UK as they were in the US. Her stepped in for breast cancer, urban talks for colon cancer, a vaccine for colon cancer, drugs that really had a big impact when they reached the market. were delayed coming onto the market in the UK. And that's, that's the vibe has gotten wider over time. And I think you're going to continue to see that play out in terms of outcomes. Yeah. And, and it gets to go course of the debate of single payer systems versus non single payer systems. concept reminder that, well, you know, Americans are going to Canada and going to Mexico to buy their drugs. And I think it's important to say, well, the other side of that, though, is that the Canadians and the British are coming to MD Anderson in Houston when they have a really, really rare, difficult cancer. They're not staying in their home country. They're coming here because we might be drug buying some kind of generic well-known drug bear because that their system is different, just easier to buy it. But for quality health care, they have to come here. And so which side would you rather? I'd rather be in our situation in their situation. And I think they're trying to find that healthy balance between the two, making, especially making, I think, old technology more affordable, and that's what I get through a discussion about, you know, generic drug approvals and whether those are therapies or medical device, whatever it is, and making that a work imperative system. But you also can't kill the goose that led the Golden Egg and kill the innovation that gives you the health care in the first place. You can say that health care is free. Good. I think there's a lot of week we're doing to make older drugs more affordable, particularly after the patents have lapsed and drugs should be subject to generic competition. In many cases there are, but they are, but in some cases they aren't. We're Congress intended for there to be brisk competition from generic alternatives. You're not seeing that into the market and there's some policy and regulatory reasons why in certain cases that's not happening. But when you look at what's happening in Europe with respect to some of these you know, more expensive, but more advanced therapies. The ones we're talking about here, selling gene therapies, but also allowed the new biologics that are coming on to the market. Patients just aren't getting access to it. And, you know, for a long time, and I've filed this pretty closely for a long time there was a real, um, We're volts the wrong word, but there was a recognition among patients in Europe that they weren't getting timely access to some of these new therapies and you saw them pressuring their governments. That's died down. You see less organized pressure from patient groups in Europe. who are getting timely access to some of these new therapies because I think there's just been a sort of recognition that has set in that they just can't afford them and companies in many cases just aren't launching the drugs in those countries as quickly as they'll launch them into U.S. or Japan as well. And it's sad because you could also, so if a drug is a therapy, if the cell therapies is a million dollars, and you're telling me that's, that's largely because of the actual, like a laboratory process that is required to even do it. It's an expensive, and of course a lot of it is, is paying back their investment, which was perhaps sometimes, and sometimes in the billions. especially for the clinical trials we were describing earlier. The overall price per patient could be lowered if the market was bigger. I think that's the general economics of it. But we're stuck in this position where they either weigh under sell it to European countries or under price it to European countries just to get it out there, which sounds like it can't even be done with sell therapies because it's not like a pill. It's the actual process of doing it's very expensive. And so you can't scale. I guess the point I'm making is when you can't scale, you can't lower price. And so we're stuck, but at least we're at least we have something. And figure out how to pay for it. is all of the issue. I haven't my notes here. I don't know if you wrote about this or my staff just wanted to ask you about it, but on the warranty. Is that an innovative way to think about paying for some of these extremely expensive therapies? Yeah, I think when you're especially when you're dealing with a gene therapy, where in many cases it's going to be a one-time administration and you're hoping to make sure it is ease. But if you think about it, you're not going to be delivering the therapy over the course of 10 years or the lifetime. So you have to recoup all the investment. all the returns in that single administration, and that's why the cost of these therapies are so high. In those cases, what you might want to do is try to amortize that cost out over time. And so it's something like a warranty where if the treatment isn't durable, Gene Derby, if the effect that it's intended to have doesn't last three years or five years or ten years, it doesn't offer a durable cure for the disease, like what's anticipated at the outset, the company might owe back some of the money. So rather than loaded all into that single administration, the company's still on the hook or the performance of that product over time, because in many of these clinical trials, when Gene Derby is coming on to the market, Part of the uncertainty is, you don't know whether or not the effects are going to be durable. We'll try my last two years in the patient's clinical response might last two years in the clinical trial, but then five years out, is that effects still going to be there? And in fact, we've seen with some of these therapies that the benefit wanes over time. And so a warranty or finding a way to amortize the cost over time is one way to deal with those very high upfront costs that aligns with some of the uncertainty around benefits that the products intended deliver. What would that do? I mean, we wouldn't make the upfront cost different. How does it change the incentives to improve the situation? Maybe I'm not following it. Yeah, well, in a simplest form, you might think of something where the company gets paid a certain amount over five years. And they'll, let's say the insurance company will pay X amount of year one, X amount of year two, out to five or six years. And they'll say, well, if the benefit starts to decline in year two or year three or year four, then we won't Oh, those other payments. So that way instead of paying for all the money upfront, they spread it out over time. And the company was on the hook where the performance of the drug over that period of time. Oh, I see. That would be the simplest way. Yeah. Right. There's others. The finance schemes that you could think about, but that would be the simplest. You know, but it becomes cumbersome because with the insurers company will say is, you know, it's going to be hard to file the patient for five years. We're going to lose, we're going to lose that patient. They're going to switch insurers plans. How do we continue to file them? So then you have to think of how do you create intermediaries in the market where you can continue to collect that data and hold the drug company sort of accountable for the results. So they're parted to implement these things as a practical matter. They make a lot of sense as a policy matter. Well, that's a little thing about value-based medicine, right, as opposed to fee for service. It's, it, it, uh, in theory sounds great in practice, that it's very difficult to implement, because value is inherently a word that is It is subjective and nature to place value on something. It's usually some kind of subjectivity involved. And I think that's why the system often defaults to this sort of fee for service coding, where, okay, I do this procedure. I get this much money. I know that had a time, et cetera, et cetera. Focus on the inputs rather than the outcomes. Yeah, because it's easier to measure the inputs rather than the outcomes. very much so and I don't know if we figured out how to do that kind of value-based care or do you think we have or some insurance companies will ahead on that as they're a good model that we would look to and it will change something pretty dramatically here but I think Medicare and other private insurers have started to do it more effectively. And particularly when you look at the delivery system, now where more providers are capitated, meaning they're taking, they're getting paid a lump sum and taking risk. They're starting to invest in ways to measure their clinical outcomes in the clinical performance over large populations. And so I think that the tools for measuring the things that you would tie the payment to have gotten a lot better. And you're starting to see more insurance contracts get written based on those outcomes. The measure of those outcomes. What about last question before we go to spend an hour? How do you think AI starts to play into this entire conversation, especially with FDA regulation? We've had a few hearings on it, a few discussions on it in the committee. My problem with the discussion of AI is always that it's often times that we're just talking about advanced software, not really AI. I think the real interesting part about how AI could plan to health care is is when we start talking about a diagnosis and, you know, can you, are we going to get to a point where you, you, you just, you, you have a conversation with an AI doctor and, and, and, and they diagnose you and is, is that could, will that ever be an FDA approved decision? Who knows? And how do you even? I guess there's ways to test it, of course, but I mean, it's, what do you think of? Yeah, look, I think it will be, and I think it can be. So, you know, separating out AI and the drug development side, the drugs that come out of some of these natural language processing, these large language models, I think there will be drugs that are where an AI augmented process are helping to develop drugs. Those drugs are going to be put through a traditional regulatory scheme that's still going to have to go through clinical trials. And if anything, I think the AI tool in that scenario is going to help explain the biological plausibility of the drug. Why the drugs should work in a certain disease? Because what AI tools solve for its plausibility? And so to extend that there is a better understanding of why the drug would work in that certain disease, that actually could be helpful in making the regulatory process more streamlined. Because the more that FDA understands about why a drug should be working in a particular circumstance, and you go on and demonstrate that with clinical data, that gives the agency more confidence. On the medical device side, so using an AI tool, a large language model to actually interact with a patient and help facilitate diagnosis and many cases, even potentially make the diagnosis, I think the technology is sufficient right now, probably to be using these tools in certain lower risk, more routine circumstances. The challenge is nobody really wants to take an LLM through the regulatory process because people are unclear about how FDA would approach it. And so they're positioning these large language miles right now is what they call clinical decision support software. So they're saying, well, this AI model is to help inform the provider and give the provider more insights. And so you might go on to a telehealth platform and your initial interaction might be with an AI tool that's asking you questions and formulating a presumptive diagnosis. And then it now passes that information onto the doctor and then the doctor interacts with you or the provider interacts with you. So the tool in that circumstance is for clinical decision support. There is the capability I believe in certain lower risk settings with AI tool to not only interact with the patient, but you know even prescribe therapy. If you think about what the chief complaints are, that most people go to a primary care physician with, it's, you know, pain on your nation, back pain, belly aches, it's routine things. Some of them could be serious, but the AI tools probably are sophisticated enough to know when to default to a provider and when it's something that's more routine based on the questions that they have, where it can be dealt with more and more routine fashion. How do you get regulatory approval for that? FDA is not going to be able to repropart the AI model. It's black box. They're not going to be able to figure out how it's working. And so the regulation needs to be put on the front end and the back end. What I mean by that is FDA needs to figure out. How do we regulate the training sets, the clinical data training sets that these AI tools are trained on to make sure that the data itself is reliable enough, is representative enough, so the AI tools being trained on an appropriate body of data. And then how do we query the AI tool with a sort of standard battery of questions to make sure that the answers that is giving are consistently accurate or accurate enough as accurate as a provider would be? And that regulatory construct isn't isn't fully created. I think the first companies that bring these tools through regulatory approval, what they're going to have to do, it's probably going to be some telehealth provider who's well funded. And what they'll have to do is bite off indication by indication. So they'll have to get approval for this chief complaint and that chief complaint and that chief complaint and couple enough of these together, within maybe they can get approval for a general use case in a primary care setting, which would be a long way off. It's art, but I still have that. So if the final approval is always still a human physician, why do you need any FDA approval? Because there's really conceptually not much difference between that physician doing a lot of Google research and just doing a lot of internet research themselves and coming up with an explanation or having their assistant do it. Let's say another human resident do the same thing and then they check the work to make sure it makes sense. Oh, sorry. I mean, in the circumstance, where the physician is the final, you know, touch point, that wouldn't be FDA proof. That would, that would, that would. So is that currently how it is, or are we, are we used to be? Yeah, that's not where. So that would be, that's a very right. That's okay. So that's carved out FDA does regulate some clinical decision spores off where but typically isn't regulating these tools. As long as the position, as long as the tool itself, ultimately defaults to the position. So what is doing is interviewing the patient preparing, coming up with a presumptive diagnosis. But that's not the real value, right? You laid it out at the outside. No, eventually, eventually, no, if you're on a spaceship for, you know, maybe it's the enterprise or something like that and you need to have a holographic doctor on board, because it doesn't take up any oxygen. Yeah, but even if even diagnosing, you know, flu or stripper or something simple, we can couple a diagnostic test with an interaction with a large language model that's trained on that. I think that the tools now are capable enough to handle those lower risk interventions and no went to default to a provider, but nobody's developing the tools for those purposes because they're worried about, you know, they're worried about how they're going to be regulated and the cost of complying. Okay, so maybe that's the, and these hearings, honestly, the conversations are, are not good because I don't think everyone understands AI, but I think you've laid it out right clearly for us on the questions we need to be asking, which is, you know, you need to, FDA, you need to start setting parameters for this future so that the technology actually, innovators have an incentive to develop the technology in first place. Although, if you're talking about assisting a doctor, I mean, why is the technology all that different? I mean, it's clearly not as advanced, but it shouldn't be that different, right? Because the goal for even if its clinician is assisted technology should be to provide a final answer to step into need of approval from a doctor. Is there something out there that's really impressive? By the way, as far as that's kind of software is concerned. Well, if there's tools already that have been doing that that layer on to electronic medical records and query physicians or look at lab results and make sort of a presumptive analysis or diagnosis and inquiries the physicians this this these kinds of tools these sort of machine learning tools have existed for a while if you think about tools that radiologists are using to diagnose findings on x-rays or pathologists are using to look at the slides. Those aren't true. Those aren't the large language models that we think about with like chatGPT. Those are forms of machine learning where they're basically engaging in forms of pattern recognition. They're trained on closed data sets and taught how to identify certain findings by being shown a lot of different findings. I wouldn't call it AI. Yeah, I would. I would call it AI. I would call it AI. It's machine learning as a point of view. Okay. We'll opportunity to say that I think you're talking about as the large language models. So I'm doing analysis right now where we're feeding the medical licensing exam to the different large language models to see which is the best doctor. But I think right now based on my kind of Cursory experience with these and doing some of this work. It looks like Claude from anthropic may be the best at answering medical questions better than Google's Gemini advanced and better than chat QPT 4.0. Yeah, I'm not recommending to go out to use it as a doctor, but it does look like the most reliable right now. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, everyone says, you don't need to see a doctor. Just Google it. It'll be fine. It's then. That would be interesting. We look forward to continuing to work with you on ways we can improve FDA policy because I think in the end, get people the access to innovations and healthcare that they need. Scott Gottlieb, thanks for being on again. Appreciate you. Thanks, Lot."

And Colonel, that's enough of the business. All right, everybody, gather round, grab a chair, grab a beer. Let's talk some true crime. Just before 4am, February 10th, 1999. Scarborough Police received a call from a motorist, reporting a body lying in the center of Pine Point Road. Michael Lopes was a passenger in a car. He was catching a ride home to Old Orchard Beach from work. The night was pitch black. There were no other cars on the road. Michael saw no persons walking and nothing unusual during the drive. When suddenly, the driver was forced to swear to avoid hitting something in the road. It appeared to be a body. When the car stopped, Michael got out and ran over to the body and knelt beside it. He first thought that someone had been hit by a car, but no. The body appeared to be placed there, so very perfectly, in the middle of the road. Michael grabbed a shoulder, slowly turned the body over, only to see the young, expressionless face, the vashley Olet. Her eyes were closed, a blueish hue on her cheeks, her skin felt warm, but she had no pulse. This is True Crime Garage. Ashley O'Leb was born March 29, 1983, a beautiful Soko main, which is in York County. Her parents are Robert and Lisa, and together they ran a successful real estate agency. They have one other child, a daughter, Lindsay, who is just a couple of years younger than Ashley. Ashley's father, Robert, lived in Soko, all of his life, his whole entire life. He was the president of his class for four years in high school. This is at Thornton Academy. He was a member of the city's historic commission and his brother Ashley's uncle is a former Soko city counselor. Her mother was not from Socho, Lisa moved to Old Orchard Beach at just four years of age. Her family moved from Quebec. Ashley's mother has seven siblings that she remains close with, so she's from a very big family. Lisa considers herself to be a family-oriented home body. Ashley is growing up in Soko main in the 90s. This is a beautiful area. There you will find beaches thick woodlands and like one would expect on the coast. There are plenty of islands to visit. This is a beautiful New England town 17 miles south of Portland main. So it's about a 23-minute drive south of Portland. The OLED house was a modern bright yellow cape caught in a wooded, better homes and gardens type neighborhood. The yard in landscaping was always top notch, always meticulous. It was well known that Ashley's parents would do anything for their children. In fact, her friends used to tell Ashley, you've got it made, and Ashley would respond, I know. Some of her things that she loved, she loved Italian sandwiches, who doesn't. She idolized Marilyn Monroe, Norma Jean, Mortensen, and Ashley kept her Hollywood style bedroom so tidy She was known as Miss Meat to her family. She kept her shoes lined up in uniform rows in her closet. Her clothing, shirts, shorts, pants all piled up neatly in dresser drawers. She kept perfume bottles, makeup containers, nail polish and such, all lined up and arranged very neatly and precisely on her bedside table. Ashley was fun and outgoing. She made friends very easily. Now, some described her as headstrong, and at times even a little defined. An elementary school Ashley was a very good student. Her second great teacher said Ashley was like a sponge because she just absorbed everything. But then came her time at Soko Middle School. Her mother says, The Ashley was always an A student. This up until middle school. The middle school years became difficult for Ashley and this was more I think captain of a social thing, not so much an intelligence thing. You know, we see this in a lot of kids' lives when they start to become very social, social butterflies if you will. This social part of school becomes much more important than the academic part of school. Yeah, she was a attractive young lady and I think she's getting attention from the seventh and eighth grade boys. And I think that led her to Maybe take the social aspect of school a little more serious than the academic side and who doesn't love a little bit of attention and it seems like she really enjoyed the attention. Yeah, when I was in sixth grade, I got a lot of attention from the seventh and eighth grade boys as well. I was the guy that had to sit in the corner in every classroom. So the grades for Ashley, they start to drop a little once she hits six grade and then they stay low in unimpressive in seventh grade as well. This is about the same time that she starts to disregard some of her parents and household rules. So she has a curfew of 9 p.m. when she's in seventh grade. She didn't just break that curfew once. She is disregarding this curfew regularly. In eighth grade, she started smoking cigarettes. She's drinking a little bit and staying out later and later. And it's well known that some nights she didn't even come home at all. Efforts to reason with her from her parents. You can picture how this is going to go. Mom and dad are going to try to enforce the household rules, try to straighten out daughter, this is going to turn into arguments and it's going to turn into parents butting heads with their young daughter. It seems Captain like at this point Ashley's a bit of out of control. It's also believed that she may have become sexually active around this time. Now, I do want to clear something up because I didn't think that this was an accurate depiction of what was going on. Some reports state that she had run away several times or run away many times. I don't find that to be truthful at all. And frankly, I don't like the way that that's reported. What the way that I think it should be reported is how we just stated it. She's breaking curfew. Sometimes she's not coming home at all. That's because she's out with friends and choosing not to come home. She's not running away from a bad household or from parents that she does not love. She's just breaking mom and dad's rules. In fact, we do know that Ashley was very close with her mother, even though they had some of these disagreements. Now, over the next two years of Ashley's life, her parents, they're going to struggle because they're trying to reign her in a little bit. She's got this wild spirit. She's a free spirit, but they also don't want to push her away. So they're kind of walking a tight rope. The other thing too, keep in mind, Ashley has a younger sister. And you don't want older sister kind of paving the way of doing whatever the heck she wants for the younger sister, thinking that that is acceptable. Well, like I said, Ashley's hanging out with some individuals that are just a little bit older than her, but some Some teenagers get this mentality of like, I want to be adult. I want to grow up faster than one should. And now looking back on things, it's like, you know, it'd be nice to stay that age for a little bit longer. I agree with you. There's there's times I wish I would have stayed 15 forever. Yeah, no bills for a couple of couple of decades at least. So her parents decide that they're going to enroll her at this place called Sweetsur Children's Services in Saka. This is for a week of inpatient counseling. And then in 1998, Ashley enrolled in Thornton Academy's Alternative Education Program. So now she's attending the same school that her father once attended, but she's going to be taking this alternative education program, which is geared towards kids who are struggling in mainstream classes, remember she's struggling because of not taking school seriously and being worried too much about being social and hanging out with friends. But between these two programs, it seems like mom and dad have done some good things here and did some things right because Ashley started to turn her life around a bit. This is from her dad. He says after her sweets are things started to get better. She was really making an effort and he says that he was proud of that. Ashley's grades were improving and she was doing much better at home as well. And he says that she was even trying to quit smoking. Well, again, teenagers go through phases and sometimes they realize, hey, this is not Me breaking her few, me running around with these knuckleheads and causing my family all this guff, right? It's not worth it. So maybe I should just get my act together. Her parents say that she was also seeming to develop better friendships and they thought that she was acting more maturely. better friendships is a good thing too because right when when the kid brings home some some. No coer girl that yeah, knucklehead that is seems to be a shady character. You you wonder oh when my child leaves these four walls. Does he or she behave like the person that they just brought home to meet mom and dad? Yeah, I think Rocky said it in Rocky one best if you hang out with coconut friends and you become a coconut. This is really impressive here at this young age. Ashley coached a classmate. Her name is Kimberly. really helped her through a pregnancy and a childbirth. And she was also trying to help a friend who was battling bulimia. So two very serious situations and I love seeing Ashley step up here showing some maturity and also showing that she's got the backs of her friends that are going through some difficult times. Yeah, and I know it sounds cheesy, but service to others becomes a service to yourself. Now, as we all heard in today's trailer, unfortunately, this is a homicide case. In 1999, Ashley was just a sophomore at Thornton Academy at the time of her death. She would have graduated in 2001. Well, let's dive into the timeline of this case. So we're looking at Tuesday, February 9th. Again, this is 1999. We have Ashley. She's 15 at the time. She asked her mother if she can stay the night at a friend's house. It's a school night. Normally, this won't fly in most households, but mom says you know what she was going to make an exception here. Well, the friend only lived like a mile away. Yeah, so her mother at least says, yes, that's our rule as well in our house. You don't stay the night or have friends over to stay the night on school nights, but She was involved in these two programs. Her grades were coming up. She was acting more materially. I think mom thought that this might be a little bit of a reward or a little pat on the back to say, hey, we see you're making an effort. We know that you are concerned about being social and you want to hang out with your friends. How about you go and have a little evening at your friend's house? Mom thought all would be fine. She was expected. Ashley was expected to go to school. with her friend that she was staying the night at her house with the following morning. This friend, her name is all light, page. Now, mom says later, she's going to tell the papers, quote, I almost said no because the rules you don't go out on a school night, but she said to me, Ashley, Mom, I've been doing so well. So I said, OK, now here is where things start to get tricky, right? So Mom takes Ashley. Remember, she's only 15. So she's not able to drive herself at this time. Mom takes her to her friend's house. And later, would say, when we got there, the two cars that she saw parked in the driveway were the cars that she knew belonged to all of his parents. These are her parents cars or friends parents cars. So, mom says, I drop her off and I'm thinking driving away. It's all good. The kid's parents are there. As the captain said, all I page lived at 57 James Street. This is near downtown Soko. This is only about a mile from Ashley's home, which is located on Thunder Road. Well, and she was also a good friend and she was a good person. So it's like, okay, you know, it's not like you're having your daughter spend the night on a school night with some skumbum, right? This is a good friend, good person, good influence. They've been good friends for a long period of time. What we're going to find out later, sadly, is that all I pages parents were not home that night. This was a ruse. Little Miss Page was going to be having a little party at her house that night in her parents absence. So let's go to 10 p.m. that night. Now one thing that we know happened for certain Ashley calls her parents and she's calling to check in because she wants to know had anybody called for her at her home that evening. Her mother said that the girls were painting their nails. That's what they told them. Ashley said that she, you know, normal. I love you, go back and forth. I love you, mom. And mom says, I love you too. Sweetheart. And unfortunately, those will be the last words that the two will exchange. A little deeper into that timeline here, Captain. Let's go to the press hero. So after Ashley talks to her mom, We have some young boys that are going to be coming over to for this party. And soon after we have a guy named Edwin Hernandez. He's age 19 at this time. So unfortunately we have some young teenage girls and there might be some teenage boys there, but we know of at least one adult male at this party at this time. Now, Edwin is asked by Ashley if he would give her a ride to another location. She tells this is according to Edwin and according to some of the people that were at the party that night. Ashley tells Edwin that she needed to get to her aunt's house because she was going to be babysitting her nieces or nephews in the morning. This guy agrees to give her a ride. Now actually what we would learn is really having him drive her to Steven Sandboard's house. So this is seven miles away from the party house at 50 mast hill road. This is a double wide set far back in the woods down a long dirt road. We have some better insight as to Ashley's intentions. This from her good friend, all I page who says that before Ashley left, she says to her friend, I want to go see Steve when I get a buzz. I get a crush on Steve. a little bit of a background Steve. And Ashley of no in each other for a couple of years by this point. Ashley gets to Steve's house now. Keep in mind as far as we know and everything we're being told by all accounts. Edwin Hernandez does not know. that he is taking Ashley to another boy's house. He is under the rules that I'm driving her to a relative's house. Ashley gets to Stephen's house and knocks on the door and there's no answer. So, Edwin then drives her five miles back into town. This to use a pay phone, remember those things? There used to be a bunch of them. Now, just to find out. Yes, Superman used to change his outfits in those. So they're at a pay phone at a gas station. This is on flagpond road and route one. And this is at approximately 1045 PM. And I'm betting you, Captain, that the police have record of this as they should, this being a call that was paid for. Ashley calls the Sandborn House, and there's a guy named Christopher Cody, who's living there. He's 18. I believe he's 18 at the time. He's staying at the Sanborn house. I don't know the particulars of why he is staying there. But it's reported that he is the one that answers this call. It's reported that he tries to wake up Steve, but Steve is sleeping and says he doesn't want to talk to Ashley. So no answer at the door, not receptive to her call according to the people that are available today to tell us what happened that night. But as the report goes around midnight, Edwin drops Ashley back off at the sandborne house and then he after seeing her gain access to the house will then leave. And it's reported that he goes back to the party that he and Ashley had left earlier. The report here is a little bit odd. Ashley knocks on the rear door to the basement of the Sandborn house. This is where there's two Sandborn boys, right? We have Daniel Sandborn who is 16. And we have Steven Sandborn who is, I'm a little confused here because some reports state that he's 18. And I've seen a couple reports that say he was 19 at the time. So somewhere in that age, age range. She's knocking on the rear door to this home. This door leads to the basement. And it's my understanding captain that both the Sanborn brothers each had a bedroom located in that basement. All right. So now we're at about 1230. Daniel Sanborn 16, brother of Stephen wakes up with the knocking. This is according to his statements. He said that Ashley entered the home on her own and met, he met her in the hallway. Now, there are plenty of reports that are backed up with multiple accounts that Daniel was at the same party that Ashley had came from and that he was there from approximately 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. Maybe he was sleeping, maybe he wasn't. I think that there's a lot of questionable details within the statements. Yeah, it seems like he had a relationship with Ashley, like on again, off again relationship. Steve for my understanding, Steve did. What makes it difficult here, Captain, is we got two Sanborn brothers. The way I understand it is that Daniel, the younger brother, may have had a crush on Ashley. Ashley, not so interested in Daniel, because she had had a previous relationship with Steve, the older brother. And as we were just told, she had said to her good friend that she still had a crush on older brother, Steve. But she would know Daniel, because he would be a classmate of hers at that Thornton Academy. We also already covered that the friend of the Sandborn's Christopher Cody was living at that home at the Sandborn home, also at this time. So that's another variable that we have to throw in there. So the reports are that Ashley arrives at the home around 12 to 12 30 a.m. We have parents, Muriel and Earl Sandburn, or they are home at the time. Ashley asked the mother if she can stay the night. According to the Sanborn mom, she says that Ashley told her she needed a place to stay because she had gotten into an argument with her parents. that evening and they kicked her out of the house. Right. We have lies upon lies upon lies. And some of them coming from our victim. Right. Mrs. Sandborn says, you know what? I'll help you out. You're allowed to stay the night, but you're going to have to sleep on the couch and the basement. Now again, mind you. Her sons, bedrooms are also downstairs in this basement area. At 1245 AM, Maryel says she saw Daniel, her son getting an orange soda from the upstairs fridge. When asked what he's doing, he says he's getting a drink for Ashley and she sees her son take the soda downstairs to Ashley. The report here is that Ashley says that it is too hot for her to sleep in the basement, and that she decides to go upstairs to sleep on the couch that is located in the living room. And according to Daniel Sandborn, he says that this is the last time. So we're at 1245 AM approximately. He says that this is the last time that he ever sees Ashley. Oh, that. Yeah, basically, everybody's storing at the Sandberg house is that she left. She eventually decided to leave on her own accord. Yeah, she went to go sleep on the couch. Everybody went to bed. We wake up and she's gone. She must have got up and decided that she was going to leave at some point that night. All right, we are back on words and upwards. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast.

TCG will save you 10% on your ticket. We hope to see every one of you there. All right, Captain. We talked about the evening, the movements of our young lady here that that night. And look, she's she's twisting things a little bit herself to maybe get what she wants or to do whatever she wants that night to go where she wants that night. I also think a lot. Yeah, and I'm also not going to pretend that we're getting the full story and every truthful detail from all parties involved. Absolutely not. And I say that with not just the people at the Sandburn home, but also the teenagers and young adults that are attending this party on a Tuesday night on a school night. Maybe not everybody knows what's going on. Maybe people have reasons for not telling the truth. We'll let the listeners decide for themselves. What we have here is now we have the Sanborn parents. They say that they got up that morning at 6.45 a.m. And when they woke up that morning, Ashley, who they told could sleep on the couch, not there at their house. I don't want to point a lot of fingers here, but I think there needs to be some finger pointing here. I think that unfortunately that there is something that everybody, multiple people You will see throughout this true crime story. I think that there are things that a lot of people wish that they would have done differently. Yeah, I mean, first of all, we have Ashley's mom that has come out. She said, look, I wish I never would have let her go. It was a school night. Then he had Ashley's friend that says, Hey, I wish I would have never let her leave the party. Then you have the mother saying, Well, once Ashley got to our house and is saying that, Hey, I had this argument with my mother and my parents and I just need to please to stay. She probably wishes that she would have just said, you know what, you can't stay here and I'm going to drive you back to your parents house. Look, I'm not trying to be bad cop to the kids out there. I'm not trying to to play detective every day of my life, but I'm just one of those people that I I want a little more information right when a kid tells me something. I don't just always believe that it's true and again, I'm not trying to fault anybody here, but I know in my heart that Ashley's mom wishes she could go back in time and just get out of the car, knock on the door and say, hey, kid, it's nice that you're having my daughter stay the night tonight. Would you mind if I spoke with your mom or dad real quick? Right. I know that I hope that the sandborn mom, I really wish that she would have picked up the phone and just said, you know what, if you want to, if you want to stay here, I don't want to kick, I'm not trying to kick you out. But can we just, can I just have a quick phone call with your mom or dad to confirm that, you know, that you need a place to stay tonight? And maybe maybe I guess in her defense that she thought that the kid would run off if if she tried to pull that move. I still think that that's probably the right move. I don't know. These stories are always difficult to tell. And when you're researching it and you're going through the information, there's always these parts that I know that everybody wishes that they could change, couldn't stop myself from voicing that here, not trying to blame anybody, but we all have regrets. I know that I have regrets. There's always things that we know that we could have done differently and probably better. We have these time points. These events that take place in a very short timeline. The next point in our timeline is at 357 AM on February 10th. Remember the party was at her friend's house the night before February 9th. This is when Mike Loops. He's driving home and there's a little more detail in this that I think is necessary. He is actually requested a ride. He was having some vehicle trouble. So he's leaving work and he's going home and he's now in the car with his mob and they are driving and they're out in the middle of this dark desolate stretch of road. This is Pine Point Road in Scarborough, Maine. Yeah, and if you saw a picture of this in the daytime, there's nothing to the left and nothing to the right. It's just nothing. Does it road and nothing? I was lucky enough to go to Maine and I tell you, that's part of the beauty of the state that there's not a whole lot of stuff, right? Not a whole lot of man-made stuff that's cluttering up the area. This spot would be roughly 10 miles from the Sandborn residents. And Mike Loops was say that when they're driving, they come across what they think appears to be a body that's lying in the middle of the road. We would later learn that this is Ashley. This turns out to be Ashley. Mike says in the beam of the headlights, it looked to him like whoever it was. And he actually says that he couldn't tell if it was male or female, just that it was a person. He thought that the person looked to have been placed there. and that she was lying face down on the centered line of the road. Now, he actually approaches the body, tries to turn her over and he says that she was blue. There was a little bit of blood around her mouth. This February, and it's in Maine, so it's pretty cold, but her body is still warm to the touch. You're exactly right. So it was 36 degrees would be the high for that day. Let me be clear, the average high for February and Maine is 36 degrees. The low, the average low would be 16 degrees in February. So it's probably somewhere in that range. He says that when they approached the body, that again, that she was lying there almost like she was placed there, neatly. Her arms are at her sides. Her legs are straight, toes are pointed down. And as the captain said, her body was still warm, even in the cold February night. Yeah, and look, when you're driving on these, I guess you call them a rural road, but you got to be careful of deer or other animals that might jump into your pathway. And then you see this object from everything I read, it seems like they had to, you know, swerve and make sure they didn't hit it. He gets out of the car, realizes that a person turns her body over, you know, she's warm to the touch, tries to do CP on her. And then you go, well, why would this person be in the middle of the road? Did they get hit by a car? Well, you wouldn't have your arms placed to your side. Your legs wouldn't be straight. There was no evidence that she was hit by a car. So then it's like, who placed her here and why? Yeah, you're exactly right captain. The body showed no signs of vehicular trauma, like you would expect to see if she had been hit walking across the street. or having been standing in the road for any number of reasons. And it was clear that part in the term that she was dumped there. And so police are going to come out rather quickly. She's fully closed, right? No signs of vehicular trauma. And police come out pretty quickly and they say, look, this is what we're dealing with here. Between sometime between 12 30 AM and 4 AM roughly on February 10th. We believe the cause of death was homicide by strangulation. So they're saying we believe between this time frame, 12, 30 and 4 AM, someone wrapped their hands around Ashley's throat and strangled her to death. And then placed the body where it's later located. Some articles say that they think that she was late in the middle of the road, hoping that she would get run over by a car. And I absolutely agree with that. I mean, we've covered boys on the tracks, boys in the road. The boys on the tracks case, that's exactly what the murders wanted to happen. The bodies would be destroyed by the train passing over them. And in this case, we get really lucky here as far as investigators go and in the public in general, hatch had a car run or a large vehicle run over her that night after she was placed there. This thing may have been ruled an accident. We could have a whole different set of circumstances here, right? Unfortunately, we have a homicide that we have to deal with, but at least in this case, we know that it's a homicide. We know the cause of death. And we also know based off of many people's accounts, the timeline of that night. Well, like I said, if you saw a picture of this area, there's nothing to the left or to the right of the roadway. Makes me wonder if these individuals knew this area took her to maybe dispose of the body and some other manner and either got nervous or just decided to change plans and then say, well, let's just dump her in the middle of the road. The interesting thing here too, as far as the investigation goes, is that other than a very short period of time. There's not a whole lot of question as to Ashley's whereabouts, because we have a whole bunch of people all who state and agree that at 12 midnight to 12 45 a.m. Ashley was on two different couches at the Sandborn home, which is like we said about 10 miles away from where she is located. So with such a short timeframe here. I mean, at 1245, she's on the couch in the living room and then at 357, she's found in the middle of the road. Body still warm to the touch and I actually believe I can't speak to the traffic. For that particular night, during that particular window of time, but I kind of believed Captain that she was probably placed there closer to the time that she was found. Having, as you said, the way it was described is that they had to swerve to avoid hitting whatever that was in the road. Has she been there for a longer period of time? I believe that somebody may not have been able to swerve and avoid not hitting whatever that was in the room. So based off of all of the statements, when talking with mom, when talking with her friend, locating a person that drove her out to the San Pern home, for investigators, it's time to go get some search warrants and go talk to some teenage boys. They're able to secure a search warrant for 50 masked hill road. This is the San Pern home. At the home, we don't know everything that they found or were exactly what they were looking for and may not have found, but it has been reported some of the items that they did find that seem to be items of interest. One was a trail of blood droplets in the kitchen area that was leading to the living room. It's also stated that they seized evidence of sexual activity. We don't know exactly what that means. They seized these items. or item. We do know that they also collect in a condom. Boys in blue, the ladies and boys in blue took a carpet and a poultry samples as well and a purple cord and a bed spread. They also collected jewelry, a pillow with a stain on it. And this is This is really good thorough work right here. They also took tissue, hair, and fingernail samples, and clothing from a one Daniel Sandborn. Now he's the 16 year old boy of the house. They got a warrant for Daniel's car as well. At the time he was driving in eels summit. Remember those old eels brand cars that once existed? Inside or on the body of the vehicle, they find dry brown grass. Now what's interesting here to investigators is they will say that that dry brown grass is very similar if not the same as to dry brown grass that was found on Ashley's body. They also recovered a gold ring, a black blouse, fingernail particles, a scarf, and hair. And this is all according to police documents. What we would end up with Captain is Sergeant Matthew Stewart who would tell the press, I'm not going to discuss what the test on any of this evidence revealed to law enforcement. And he also would not describe anyone in the San Bern home that night as a suspect. But what he did say is that quote, we are unable to place Ashley alive outside the San Bern residence. That's right, by several accounts, Ashley was alive and well in the San Bernard home house. Then found dead outside 10 miles away, less than four hours later. We do know that police questioned both Danny and Stephen, and we do know that Danny, according to police, changed his story a few times. He first tells police that the following morning, he woke up. Ashley wasn't there and he attended school. as normal, and then police come back and say, not so fast, Danny Boy, attendance records show that you were not at school that following morning. He changes the story to say that, well, I woke up late. Miss school called off work. He had a job. He called off work and ended up spending the afternoon with friends at Old Orchard Beach. Stephen gives police a little bit of insight into his background with the victim, Ashley. He does say, he says, look, we had a brief relationship. This would have been in 1996 or 1997. He did say that they had intercourse on numerous occasions. He told police that he figured Ashley was in Dan's bedroom with Dan that night. as far as he knew. So the way that I understand this to be is that we're looking at all the people in the sand burn home, obviously, as potential suspects. Nobody seems to be pointing the finger at the other. It sounds like Dan may have had a crush on Ashley. Ashley still wanted some type of relationship with Steve. Steve had moved on. He has his own girlfriend at this time. And then we have the other variable of the other guy that's staying and living at the Sandburn home at the time. This is really frustrating to me, Captain, that we don't have anybody pointing the finger at one another because I think that that's what police thought was going to happen early in this case. They have some evidence. They have some evidence. It's leading them back to this sandburn home. You want to figure out who is the last person that could have possibly seen or been with your victim. That is probably your killer. That is probably the person that placed or in the road. And then what you do have here is As a detective, go back to the statement of the individual that found the body and what you are seeing at the body recovery site. It's looking to you and it's looking to even the layperson, the average citizen who spotted her in the road, all saying the same thing. It looks like she was laid neatly there in the road. That little detail, that's a two person job. She wasn't dumped there. She wasn't dragged there. I hope one thing that I found, especially in these cases from the mid to late 90s, there seems to be a little bit of a, and I can't speak for certain as to this particular case, but the lack of understanding how powerful shoe prints are evidence, shoe print evidence can be in a case as well as drag mark or tire mark. evidence in a case that seems to be that we got away from that. That was a big deal in in the 70s and a lot of cases that you would see in the 70s and even in the 80s and I don't know why it's not even discussed in a lot of these cases from the 90s. It seems like something that was just missing. But so what we don't have here is a clear understanding based off of police information did they see drag marks at the scene. Because if you do have drag marks, then one person could have placed her there. Do you have any indication on her shoes or clothing that she was dragged to where the body was found? Do you have any trauma on the body that would indicate that she was just rolled off the side of a vehicle and dropped where she's found? If you don't have any of that, then you have a situation where two people likely two people picked her up. I understand there's some very strong people out there. But usually the way that this goes, Captain, is two people picked her up, place her where she was found, and therefore you either have One or two killers, but at the very least you have two people that know why and where she was placed that night. Well, it's unclear to me. You know, when you're looking into this case, if you're the enforcement, who are all the players that are involved? Okay. I can eliminate Ashley's family because she's not there. I can now start eliminating some of the people that were still at the party, the original party that she was at at her friend's house. And I think party is a loose term. I think it was more of a small gathering. My parents have gone, let's have a handful of people over and let's have some boys over. It'll be crazy. And then your friend Ashley, she leaves. Now she goes to another house. Now she's a, here's what's even stranger. We don't think something negative happened at the party where there was no parents. We think something possibly happened at the house where two parents were there. Mother and father were there saying, hey, she could stay here and we we offered our couch and she must have got up and left on her own. But who are all the players at Sandborn's house? We know the moms there. You know the fathers there. We know the brothers are there. But who else is there? Exactly. And here's the thing too, because you're spot on there, Captain, because there's rumor of somebody else, maybe one or two other people having potentially been there that night at some point that night. I actually do not see this situation as Mama Sandborn covering for one son or two sons or son and friend or friend of the sons. I don't see that situation. I look at this and I think that maybe I don't, I'm not going to pretend that most people in that house that night haven't come to some conclusion as to what took place at night. I'm not going to say that they're completely in the dark, but what I feel like happened here is where she's located to me shows impulsiveness and desperation on the on the behalf of the whoever playster there. Yes, that was my question for you. It's because if she gets hit my car or hit by multiple vehicles, that could cover up. and make it harder to figure out what happened to her. So to me, that shows some levels of sophistication, but in the middle of the road, again, like I said, there's nothing to the left. There's nothing to the right. You have a lot of wooded area in Maine. There's a lot of places to bury bodies, to hide bodies. So I don't know if this shows a level of sophistication or does it's show, like you said, a level of panic? And I think our information is different because you have a different name of who drove her to the Samborn's house. Then I, I'm, I'm slow glad that you said that because there are different reports out there. Now the, the one that I cited was from that press herald report that gave a nice timeline of that evening, pretty detailed, which I was surprised that it supplied actual names, and especially considering one of them to be under age, the girlfriend that she was going to air quote, stay the night at her house. I value the information in that timeline, but you're exactly right. There are other reports out there that says completely other individual, not this Edwin Hernandez was responsible for giving a ride to. her that night and we did talk about the movements, right? There's it seems like there was a little extra movement going on before she gains access to the sand burn home. So maybe the truth is that more than one person gave her a ride or was involved or in the vehicle, at least in giving her. Yeah, because the name I have is Jay Coney. And so you have Jay Coney, if he gives Ashley a ride. Is Jay still at the Sandborn's house? It's not clear to me. I'm not saying that the Sandborn's the parents are covering for their kids or anything like that. I don't think they know what happened, but it's like I also don't think they're maybe they didn't know what else was happening that night inside their house. I'm with you on that captain. And that's why I think that we are seeing a level of panic when trying to conceal this body or conceal the crimes that were committed, right? Let's place her in the middle of the road. Maybe she gets hit. Maybe she gets run over by a car and it looks like something else. And I think the reason why you have to get her out of the house is that, well, mom and dad are going to wake up. And they're going to go, where was that girl from last night that had to run away from home? Oh, so you have a limit if you, if they are unaware, if other people inside that home that night are unaware of what took place and they're not going to be covering for you. Now you have a limited amount of time that you have this big problem that you have to get out of the house. We're concealed in a way that nobody's going to find her in the house and then move her later, but we know she wasn't moved later because she was found at 357 AM. So you have this problem of I gotta get her out of here and I have a limited amount of time before I have to get back to the house to make it look like I slept through the night and I'm clueless as to what happened. And so that's why I think that we see the panic here. The other thing that's really dumb for the persons, and this is why I think that we're seeing whoever who ever chose to dispose of her in this manner is doing it at a desperation, but it's impulsiveness too, which typically will lean toward a younger criminal. And those tendencies always lean toward a younger criminal is that Once that heart stops beating, that body is going to behave a lot differently if she struck by a car than when the heart is still beating. Now, you can hope for a bad investigation or incompetency and then maybe it's ruled of vehicular accident, you could get lucky. That's not unheard of. But again, that body will behave differently. I part of me wonders if their thought was will will We will striker with the car and then, at the last second, they grew a little bit of a brain and figured out, well, now our car is going to show damage or show some sign that we hit somebody. And that's going to lead directly back to us. Let's place our here and maybe we get lucky in somebody else. is the one that is driving the vehicle. Yeah, and even though it's very early morning hours, there's a possibility that they got disrupted by somebody else. They saw in the distance some car had lights and got spooked and decided to abandon whatever plan that they came up with. Again, I go back to if it's very important to figure out who drove her to the Sanborn's house, but also who stayed there because obviously if this Jay Carney gave her a ride there and he stayed there, well, he'd have a vehicle. But the evidence kind of points to like you said, the Sanborn's son's vehicle has more evidence that her body was probably moved with that vehicle. And over the year, scapped, and this has been a very difficult case. And I think in large part it's difficult for the all that family because they strongly believe that they know who is responsible or has holds guilt in this case. And we see a lot of evidence of that but we should mention that there's been a lot of effort in this case as many as 30 detectives over the years have worked the case. There are currently two full-time detectives. a forensic chemist and a family advocate and of course the attorney general prosecutor who continue to keep this case in the media as well as Ashley's mother. And they still want to solve this thing. Unfortunately, we're coming up close to 25 years since this murder. We do know that unfortunately Ashley's father would pass away, not terribly long after this, this would have been a may of 2001 and a heart attack in a sleep. He was just 49 years old. his daughter's death and murder, I believe 100% contributed to his health problem, you know, this heart attack, the sudden heart attack that took place in May of 2001. What we're going to see here is the events, some terrible events that took place in a short window of time, one night, one dark night in Maine. that will affect so many lives and tear up so many lives over the years. We do know that her mother Ashley's mother firmly believes that Daniel is guilty. She is being patient because she understands that there is a big gap between proper cause and beyond a reasonable doubt. It seems like there needs to be some more evidence here before charges will be solid and be brought. In this case, but we do know that the Olet family took the Sanborn family to court. They filed a wrongful death suit against the sandboards. They claimed that they had a reasonable responsibility to protect Ashley from injury while she was in their home. They feel that Daniel injured Ashley in a way that ultimately caused her death. Now, sandboards claim is that because Ashley said that she was kicked out of her home and needed a place to stay, that They were just trying to offer her help and they're not responsible for Ashley and what may have happened. And again, they're standing by, well, we went to bed. Everything was fine. We wake up and she was gone. You've asked forward all these years later, and what we learn is that Daniel Sanborn, the brother Steven, they've both had a lot of problems with with the law over the years. And one situation, one of the brother situations has been some violent activity. And the other brother situation has been drugs theft and weapons charges. So these guys have turned out to be pretty bad guys. And a lot of it has to do with drugs and drug trafficking. A lot of times drug trafficking is just to pay for one's own drug habit and wait to get the drugs themselves. And I just wonder if these two are riddled with the truth, and that they've been medicating themselves over the years to deal with with the truth of something that they know that they were involved in, taking the life of a young girl. Well, I think we should talk about Tony Torres. Yes, Angel Tony Torres. And he enters the story in a strange twist But this would just be a couple months after Ashley's murder. And we're going to see a common denominator here. You already mentioned Jason Carney, better known as Jay Carney. He's going to be a weird common denominator here in between these two stories and between these two victims because as the captain stated, some of the reports say that it was Jay Carney that gave the ride to Ashley that night or may have been at the San Bern home that night. that Ashley was killed. The way that Angel Tony Torres works into this case. His parents, they meet their natives from Puerto Rico. They meet and fall in love in New York City. They have two young children. They decide, you know what, let's take our kids out of the city. Let's move out to Maine. So they move out to Maine where they're able to get a home that's three times the size of their New York apartment, plus it's got a yard, right? You got kids. You want to have a yard for your family. So now they have a yard. This is in 1985 when they move out. This is about a five and a half hour drive out to Denmark Maine to start their new life with their family a few years after the move. They have another son. Angel would choose to go by the name of Tony. I think he thought it was more maybe a little more masculine name. He was a very popular kid growing up. He was described by friends as social smart with a very upbeat personality. He was active at school. He was great at basketball and soccer and he loved music and he loved partying with his friends. Denmark main population of about 1100 people. This is about an hour drive Northwest on country roads from the nearest major city, which is Portland, Maine. Now remember we talked about the proximity of Ashley, Ashley's family's home in regard to Portland, Maine. So the two live about what about an hour and a half away from one another. So let's fast forward to March of 1999. This is Tony's junior year. He's attending Framingham. This is also just a short time after Ashley was killed and still it's still an unsolved murder. And the still-in-solved murder of Ashley was the talk of the town in Soko-Man. Tony's home for spring break in 1999, he's visiting staying with his parents. Now, on one of these days, he's watching the evening news and they're running a story about the Ashley OLED murder. Tony and his dad are watching. This is when Tony perks up and he says to his dad, I know who killed her. He's saying that he knew Ashley a little bit, he knew her from some parties that he says they both had attended. Tony's dad says something to the effect of a son like, look, you either need to take this information to the police or you need to zip it. Keep your mouth shut. You better be very careful about who you share this information with, right? Which, you know, Tony's father would agree that that's awful advice. You should have right then and there said, if you have information in this murder investigation, we need to go to police right now because not because you're also in danger. You're exactly right, Captain. This is another spot in our story here where we see a situation where I know somebody says to themselves today. I wish I could handle that just a little bit differently. Yeah, and he also claims that his son said this in a way that there was no doubt that it wasn't like his son said this and he looked at his son and didn't believe him or thought his son was bullshit and he believed every word why he didn't take deeper and ask for information, why he didn't make him go to police. Don't know, but later on, what's going to happen is he goes out to a party or he's partying as ex-girlfriend's house and they end up believing to go to a corner store. and he believes with Jay Carney. So then Jay Carney comes back to the party. People go, well, where's Tony at? And he says, well, he got picked up by a pickup truck at the corner store. I don't know, I don't know where he's going. Jason J. Corske. This is on Wednesday, the 19th. This is May of 1999. So now we are what three months after the murder of Ashley. And we know that we know from several people's accounts that Tony stayed at J. Carney's house on that Wednesday, the 19th and Thursday, the 20th. So they spent a couple of days together. Now it was on May 21st where they are at this house party together. And as the captain said, it's a place where his ex Tony's ex girlfriend was staying. It's around 2 a.m. that they leave, what did they say captain? They were going out to pick up cigarettes or maybe beer and cigarettes or something. Yeah, it's just going to corner store. And so J returns to the house party without Tony. There's a couple people there that say, luck when J returns. He's a mess. He's nervous. He's acting weird. He's frantic. His pants are rolled up and dripping with mud. Yeah. And unfortunately, it's not until three days later, the Tony is reported missing. He's reported missing his parents file a missing person's report with the police. This is after Tony's girlfriend calls them and says, Hey, Where's Tony? I'm looking for him. His work called said he didn't show up for work. And that's not like him at all. So now we have a missing person's report. And then we have a bunch of people saying that this J. Carnie is the last person to have been with him. And then when when other people C. J. What 30 minutes or short period of time after the two leave, And Jabra turns without Tony that this guy's a mess. He's emotionally physically a mess and his clothing is a mess as well. The story also just doesn't make any sense. We went to the corner story together. If I went to the corner story with my buddy and he got picked up and I come back alone. There's more to the story there. Yeah. Well, who did he get picked up by it? Okay, if I know that information, maybe the story starts making some sense, but he's going, well, I don't know. He just got, he got picked up by this pickup truck. This red pickup truck, and that's it. That's all I know. He would claim that the two, whatever reason they told the people the party that they were leaving, that they, they were actually going out to meet some people that they did a pretty small time drug deal with earlier that day. And I don't know if he's insinuating that the driver or the passengers of this red pickup truck that he says Tony left in, if they were one in the same, the people that they had sold some marijuana to or whatever it was earlier that day. I don't know if I having a hard time here with this part of the story. But that's what he would ultimately tell police for by understanding. We've seen this time and time again. This is what really makes my ears perk up. When somebody tells one story and then the next day they tell you a little bit of a different story to law enforcement. Now they're admitting to some pretty small time crimes. you know how the guilty parties are it's like I've just given them a little bit and they'll see that I'm being truthful this time because I'm admitting to something that I did that's breaking the law and they'll they won't push me any further and Jake Carney is the common denominator. He's somebody that is also listed in some of those reports regarding Ashley's case and also listed as being the last person agreed upon with Angel Tony Torres the night that he goes missing. And this is not a situation where anybody sitting here going, well, maybe Tony just took off on his own and started a new wonderful life somewhere. No, this is a situation where law enforcement are saying, we have every reason to believe that Tony was met with foul play. His family saying, we're not expecting to find him live and well, we're just hoping to get some information. So we can return him and bring him home for a proper burial. On here's what's crazy though, you get them. the brother of Sandborns. They become a mess of individuals themselves. Yes, with law and with drugs. And like you said, maybe self-medicating because they know what happened to Ashley that night. They're friends with Jay Carney. He's friends with Tony Torres. Tony Torres probably knew the Sandborn brothers as well. And then Tony just happens to tell his father, hey, I know what happened to that Ashley girl. And then he's hanging out with Jay Carney goes missing. Jay Carney story doesn't make any sense. No. The Sam born brothers and Jay Carney's story don't make any sense when it comes to Ashley. And look, love to question Jay Carney more about this. But he dies of a drug overdose. Yeah, you're going to have to get a shovel to go talk to Jake Carney. And again, was that self medication? Yep. He was all the way out and rode island in 2015 and he passes away dies of a drug overdose at the age of 36. So whatever information he has, he's taken that with him and he will remain silent forever. Now, of course, we don't have to dance around this anymore. The obvious thing here is that the major theory, the prevailing theory here is that Jay killed Tony, because he knew what happened to Ashley. And what I find interesting about this here, Captain, is that If J was involved in Ashley's case, and you would have to think that he was directly involved to the point that he had direct involvement of a threat of going to prison himself, not for a little bit of time for a very long time to take the life of another person. It seems so simple. With the first one, you didn't know what he was doing. How do I, how do I cover this up? How do I hide this? And I don't know what I'm doing. I've never done this before. And we play sort of in the road and somebody runs her over and that we wipe our hands of it, problem gone. I can breathe a little easier now. But that didn't happen. She was found. They figure out very easily how she was killed. They figure out very easily where she was that night and people to talk to and start collecting evidence. Did old J learn from that? And that's why with the next one, we don't find the body because he learned of all the problems that created for him or his friends or other people involved the first go round. And I want to bring up something that you brought up in Ashley's case. Is it two individuals involved? And this is why it would make more sense because if there's two individuals involved, and then Tony towards is maybe he's, maybe he's telling Jay, hey, I know what happened, where I told my dad that I knew what happened. For some reason, we have to get rid of Tony. He has gone a short period of time. So that's a very short period of time that Jay has to Kill Tony, I think get rid of the body, but it's a lot easier to do if you have two people involved. The Antonio was a strong kid, athletic kid. So it's more likely that whoever's involved with Ashley's case, if there's more than one and most likely more than one, then there's more than one involved in Tony's disappearance as well. Yeah, and this is a situation where you gotta believe of Tony knew what happened. And it's interesting to kind of ponder the varying degrees of knowledge that he could have had of what happened, right? Is it something he heard from somebody else? Who did he hear it from? What did they tell him? So on and so forth. But it's well, how we've heard this in so many cases where somebody is using substance abuse and they have to confess their crime to somebody. Well, and it's one of those situations where I believe that if Tony head knowledge of what happened to Ashley that there are other people in those social circles that probably know or may have even heard the same information that Tony heard. And as the captain pointed out and as I followed up with, there is information out there that Jay Carney gave Ashley a ride to the Sandborn's home. that night that she was murdered or that he was there at the Sandborn's home house that night. Some articles say that it was Edwin Hernandez who dropped her off. It's difficult to say at this point in time. But what we do know is that both Ashley's murder and Tony's disappearance are open and active cases with the main state police. It will be 25 years now since Ashley was killed and placed in that road and our family is still searching for answers and I hope and pray that Ashley's family gets those answers that they deserve. I hope and pray that Tony's family get the answers that they deserve and find out his whereabouts.

This is Fresh Air, I'm Tony Mosley, and my guest today, contemporary painter, sculptor, and installation artist Titus Kaffar, is known for taking classical forms of art and deconstructing them by cutting, crumbling, shredding, stitching, tarring, twisting, and binding to reveal hidden truths that challenge historical narratives. his art provokes, forcing the viewer to confront the erasure of black Americans from our historical narrative. Take his 2014 painting behind the myth of benevolence, a portrait of Thomas Jefferson peeling away to reveal Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman that Jefferson owned. His 2020 time magazine cover, A Nagleous Colors, depicted a mother holding the silhouette of a child, which Gafar created by cutting into the canvas. The image references George Floyd, calling out for his mother during his arrest in final moments. Kafar, whose paintings and art installations can be found at some of the world's most prestigious museums, has now taken his vision to the big screen, deconstructing his own life with his directorial debut, a raw and deeply personal film titled, Exhibiting Forgiveness. It's about a celebrated painter, whose carefully constructed world unravels, when his estranged father, a recovering addict, seeking redemption, suddenly reappears in his life. It's a searing exploration of forgiveness, asking us who deserves it, who owes it, and it what cost. Titus, welcome to Fresh Air. Thank you. If I'm not mistaken, this idea for the film was originally a documentary, right? How did it turn into a feature film? The documentary happened because I was going back to Michigan where I'm from Kalamazoo to visit my grandmother and when I got to my grandmother's house my father was sitting on the doorstep and I had my son with me and my wife was with me and they'd never seen him before. My kids were probably about seven and five or something like that at that time. And I basically told him, I didn't really want to talk. And that this wasn't a good time. So I walked up the stairs, walked into the house, and to my surprise, my father followed me. And now this is my maternal grandmother. And so as I was starting to get a little frustrated about the situation, my grandmother said, baby, you need to talk to him. And I say this all the time, but when my grandmother tells you to do something, you do it. There's no question. I had a camera on my shoulder at the time because I was going to take a photograph of her. I was going to make a painting and drawing for her. And so, kind of, on a whim, I said to my father, if you want to talk, let me, let me film you. There's a, there's a lot to be accounted for. And I was hoping he would say no, but he said yes, he said be in my house 15 minutes. And that was the beginning of it. And the truth of the matter is that documentary felt wildly unsatisfying. I showed it publicly in the theater one time, and decided I don't want that in the world like that. Why, what was it about it? A lot of it was just the fact that if it felt like it did a really good job of telling me where it was, but not how I got there. It was me as an adult reflecting on these things as an adult. And there was no space for that child, that child's voice in that documentary. And somehow that felt really necessary. So as I let go of the idea of the documentary project that I moved in to the idea of doing this as a feature film, I realized that it was going to be necessary for me to think differently about my father when I write him as a character. This changed your creative process because you were writing and also painting the story at the same time. This was the first time you had actually done something like this. Yeah, I mean, the writing process was very different for me. And so what happened is I'd wake up in the morning about five o'clock and I'd start writing for a couple hours. Take my kids to school and then I will go to the studio and I would I would start drawing or sketching from what I had written the day before so I have this app on my phone that allows me to listen to text so I was listening to that and remembering all of the things from my childhood experiences and and just writing that down. And initially, I was writing this stuff for the purpose of trying to tell my sons a little bit about, about their father, me, about where I come from and, you know, why I don't like to talk about when I was a kid so much. And for their whole lives, I've always said, well, I'll tell you when we older. They would ask. And so my oldest is going off to college now. So I think it's part of what initiated this whole process for me and that painting aspect of it is so that's so normal. That's my happy place. That's peace. I'm a pretty extraverted person, but that's only because I have all of this time alone in the studio. So that part felt normal, felt right, and it made the writing process easier. Because the writing process was far more emotional than I expected it to be. The process is sitting down writing made me remember things that I had pushed out of my mind for a long time. And I also, as I took it from reality and moved it into the script, it actually became more difficult when I was moving it into a script. Because if you were writing a character, you have to be honest about that character's motivations. You can't just say this is a bad guy. And as a young man, I would have told you that my father was the villain of my narrative. He was the bad guy. It wasn't until I sat down to write, and I had to ask myself, no, no, that's not enough. Why is he doing what he's doing? What are the motivations for his actions? What are the broader context of the world? Yes, that's right. You grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Yes, that's right. That was a place of industry, of factories, of businesses. And yes, that's right. By the time you were in high school, all of those businesses, so many of them had been shut down. And so there were no jobs. There were a few opportunities. And yes, that's right. Crack cocaine came in right at that same time. So with context and writing and asking myself the motivation for this character, I gained a compassion, a sympathy for my father that I never had as a young man. Titus, this story isn't completely autobiographical, but there's truth so much truth from your life in it. For those who haven't seen the film, can you say what the story is? Terrell is an artist living with his wife who is also an artist musician and you have a young son. he has a young son to a rail has a young son I have to you know I think fundamentally this film is about one artist journey towards healing Of course, there's this question of this father who re-inters the situation and whether or not there will be reconciliation or forgiveness between them. And we go with this family on this journey. The film for me is about generational healing. How do does this generation make sure that our children don't have to carry the same wounds and baggage that we carry? Is there a way for us to leave it here so that they can go on without that burden? And in the film, the artists to realm and his wife, they figure this out through the artistic practice itself. The thing that I'm most excited about is in the film, you see the practice of two artists connected, caring for one another. It's not generally the picture of an artist that you see on film. There's such a vulnerability in this film. I mean, we are seeing black men, e-mote, and express, and cry. And we rarely see that in film. Actually, we don't see that when, for men, period, let alone black men. What have been the discussions with your sons? You writing this with the intent of being able to show them that, hey, this is what my life was before you were here. Yeah. I mean, there's a moment in the film where, uh, where Jermaine, Terrell's son runs in the house and starts to jump in on the couch. And I love that scene. Daniel, uh, the young kid who played that part, he was, he's extraordinary. And he comes in and starts to jump in on the couch. And I wish I would run into the house and jump on my mother's couch. That would be a very short scene. But Terrell, he walks in and he gently grabs his son by the shoulders. And he looks him in his eye and he says, breathe. I want you to breathe with me. Let's take a breath together. And what that's about is giving the next generation different tools than we had. We weren't told that it was okay that we could cry. That was something that we had to suppress. That was something that it was necessary for us to hold in. We grew up in a kind of rough spot. You didn't want people to see you weak. That meant you were vulnerable. And if you were vulnerable, the opportunity to take you was there. And so that became another thing I began to understand is like even these things that feel harsh in the minds of our parents. This was for our protection. And I don't agree with, you know, doing that to your children. I have to believe that love and compassion and kindness and care, those things are the things that we offer to our children, and that will bring them to a peace, a place of peace and wholeness. But at the same time, recognizing that the world that I grew up in, the neighborhood that I grew up in, was fundamentally different from the neighborhood that my children are growing up in. I understand why they made the decisions they made, why they did what they did. It's interesting. You said it was kind of like therapy. You had a conversation with a couple of directors, producers, like just to get advice. You talked to Steven Spielberg, right? He said something to you about putting your life on the page like this. What did he tell you? Yeah, first shot out to Kate Capshaw, his wife, she's a painter. That's how we met. So she came to the studio and we were just geeking out about paint and you know, had these canvases there that I had been working on for the, for the film. And she asked me, she said to what is, what is all this work about? This feels a little different from your other paintings. And so I had a script in my hand and I handed it to her, signed it and said, you know, thanks for coming to the studio. Appreciate you. And Kate and I have stayed in touch. And so she read the script in about 2448 hours and got back to me and said, this is something special. Do you mind if I share it with Steven? And I said, yeah, no, of course not. That's amazing. Right. What do you know? I said, of course. And she gave it to Stephen and within a couple of days, he got back to me. And he said, do you have something very special here? Um, this is not the kind of film that Hollywood usually treats well. You have to protect yourself. It's going to be difficult. And it is not going to fix everything. Yeah. And he had just done his own family story. With the fablements. Yeah. And so, he also told me that I cried every day on set. And for me, I didn't cry every day, but to have for many days. You on the other side of the project. To be honest with you, Kate and Stephen spoke to me about the project throughout filming. And so, on the other side of the project, I would say, yeah, it's true, everything has not been fixed, but there definitely have been some revelations, like I said, about understanding the motivations of my father. That has changed. That has definitely changed for me. I want to talk to you a little bit about some of the other reasons why you wanted to make this film. You also made this movie because while you document black life, black people by and large are not the ones consuming or buying your art. And in the short documentary that you did in 2022, shut up and paint, you shared your struggle with the commodification of your art. You mentioned in there how You have family members who, at least at that point, still hadn't seen. Still to this day. Yeah. Has that ever made you question what you do? Well, actually, let me refer you to that. It hasn't made me question what I do. It's made me question where what I do goes. So I don't question painting. I love that. That's like in my heart. It's the thing that I, one of the things that I know that I was made for. But the reality is, as I said in that documentary, where I grew up, the place I grew up does not look like the place why I am now. And the people who engage with my work often don't come from that world. And let me be clear here. I'm not just talking about race. I'm talking about class as well. I feel blessed to be able to do what I do every day. I mean, I make paintings and people pay me to do that. It's kind of ridiculous. It's like let's just be honest. Let's just put that out there. It's kind of ridiculous. So I'm not complaining about that. But what I want is to figure out how I can get more access for folks. And you felt like a movie, you felt like visuals in that way was more democratizing. Yeah, as I said, I think I said in the film, the documentary film is a much more democratically accessible medium. You don't have to be a rich man to go to a movie, you know? And nobody makes you feel uncomfortable when you walk into a movie theater. You can just walk in a movie, watch a movie. Or, you know, eventually you'll be able to watch it and your home, you know. So that was that was incredibly important to me because as I went into more spaces, gallery spaces, I recognize how uncomfortable they are. This beautiful, big, white space where you are the only black face in that building. There is some fancy person sitting at the front desk and you don't know where the do I need to pay to get in. It's like trying to talk to them and say something and then you see these paintings on the wall and you're like, these are interesting, but I don't know anything about them. that kind of a leadism that one feels when they're in those spaces doesn't help people connect to the art at all. I want to play a clip from shut up and paint to delve a little bit more into some of the experiences that you have dealt with as an artist in these spaces. In this clip that I'm about to play, you're on the phone with an art dealer and you're restating what they're asking you to do, which is essentially to stop being an activist and talking about injustices and just paint. Let's listen. Okay, what you're trying to explain to me is I'm making paintings about white supremacy and that institutions that facilitate white supremacy are saying if you just didn't talk so loud about that and not say the things that it's actually about not say the things that actually motivate you to make what you make then like you know we would accept what you do and so I'm like why the fuck would I do that? At the end of the day, at least I could say like, I held my principles and they decided based on who I am, not who I pretended to be that they weren't interested. I'm okay with that. that was my guest Titus Khafar in the 2022 documentary Shut Up in Paint. There's an actual scene in this documentary where you receive notice that one of your painting sells for $1.2 million. And you're like, wow, but also how much of that are you going to get? No, I don't get any of that. You don't get any of that. No, this is not Europe. Wait, I don't know. I mean, we hear, like, your painting sale, all of these, like, extraordinary amounts of money. That's secondary and market stuff. That's part of the reason why I love that to be in the documentaries, because most people don't understand it. Most folks, you know, they see those numbers. And I'm like, oh, man, tigers are doing really well. And I'm doing all right. But the reality is that secondary market people take those two auction houses, auction houses. auction those paintings off and the person who bought it, that's the person who makes the money from it, you know. And none of that goes back to the artist, none of it, not a dime. So you might have bought that painting for, you know, the painting that was actually in question if I'm not mistaken, I think that was originally purchased for $12,000. Which was not bad for me at the time. But I think something like five years later, it was auctioned off for 1.2. Let's take a short break if you're just joining us. My guest is artist and filmmaker Titus Kafar. We're talking about his new movie, exhibiting forgiveness. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley and this is Fresh Air. Hi, this is Molly CvNusper, digital producer at Fresh Air. And this is Terry Gross, host of the show. One of the things I do is write the weekly newsletter. And I'm a newsletter fan. I read it every Saturday after breakfast. The newsletter includes all the week shows, staff recommendations, and Molly picks timely highlights from the archive. It's a fun read. It's also the only place where we tell you what's coming up next week and exclusive. This is Fresh Air, I'm Tanya Mosley. And today, I'm talking to Titus Khafar about his directorial debut, a new movie based on his life titled Exhibiting Forgiveness. It's about a painter who is battling with the trauma of his youth, the abandonment of his father, and the final days of his Ailing Mother. Titus Khafar is an acclaimed painter known for his innovative and thought-provoking works that challenged traditional historical narratives and representations. Let's talk a little bit about your techniques that might be a way to be able to visualize for those who are listening to us. You deconstruct many of your paintings and sculptures using cuts and shreds and stitches and tars and sometimes you paint over a painting. Other times you might cut out a piece of a painting as you did with your time magazine cover in 2020 that depicted a black mother holding a silhouette of a child and the child is cut out of the image. You were inspired by the last words of George Floyd, who was calling out to his mother as he was being arrested and ultimately died. Can you take us to how you came to that idea of the painting of mother essentially holding what feels like a ghost of a child? I was broken hearted, by the words of George Floyd. I was inspired, by the words of my mother. And when George Floyd died, I felt like giving up and I didn't want to talk to people. I was getting phone calls from folks like, you know, come do a public talk here and like, you know, I said, I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that because I want me to be like, hopeful right now. I'm hopeful. And so I call my mom and I was, I was just talking to her and she wasn't doing that. And my mom was just talking about how, you know, she has four sons and all of us have had some kind of running with police before that could have ended up exactly the same way. That was the thing that inspired me to make that painting. I was thinking about my mother, my mother, and her fear of losing her voice. George Floyd's words were horrifying, you know? And I don't know that that that for me could have sent me to the studio to make something, to turn it, to turn those words into something constructive. That's what that came from really. Yeah, because you talk a lot about it. I think in your TED talk, you talk about like when we look at a painting, there's so many things within the painting that we can focus on. In this particular painting, the focus is on the mother. She's centered there. She's beautiful and color and fullness. And she's holding a silhouette. Her son is gone. Yeah, the piece is called the analogous colors, but it's from a series called contours of loss. And I was just thinking about how the absence of something can imply what was there. And it makes the absence physical. And that's the thing about absence is we feel it, but it is in fact not physical. What do you do with the pieces that you cut out? Sometimes they get incorporated into other paintings. Sometimes I have a role of figures in my studio, in my storage. Right now the cutout. from the film is actually if you remember he cuts that figure out and he lays that little boy on the chair and now that chair and the cutout are in the exhibition and Beverly Hills. I'm so taken by the choices that you make like that choice. And I'm also, I'll be honest, like, sometimes uncomfortable and disturbed when you manipulate or when we see it manipulate. And the actual in result is a beautiful thing that we can all partake in. But in particular, like in the film, there's this gorgeous portrait of three boys in front of a house and then your character played by Andre Holland. covers the two boys and white paint. So like the moment he picks up that brush and then puts that white stroke, it's like, ah, like, just right. I mean, I know you've heard that before that it really disturbs people. Do you remember the first time you made that decision to do that to a piece of your work? I do. I do remember the first time. It wasn't conscious. It wasn't me conceptualizing an idea about a conversation in the context of our history. You know what I mean? I was in the studio, working on this painting. And I had spent, I was in graduate school at the time. I'd spent months working on this piece. And it just was not working. And it just wasn't not working. And there were two characters in the painting, and I just, like, actually know that first one there was only one character in the painting. And I just, I was frustrated. And I was like, you know, I'm just gonna start over. And so I had painted an oil. So in order to paint over it, I needed oil primer to go over it. And so I got my primer together. And I just started wiping it out. And I put that first brush stroke on there. And I stopped for a second and saw that something was there. And then I took a rag and I wiped back the area in front of the eyes and his eyes, the character's eyes kind of peered through and this kind of ghostly way and I didn't know what I was doing but I just kept going and I just more strokes and more strokes and more strokes and then I'd wipe it back and then pull it out again so was this this kind of this push and this pull as we say in painting and this appearance and disappearance and trying to find that balance between presence and absence. And I stopped and I looked at it and I was like, I don't know man, I think this works. And so I just sat with it for a few days before I sold anybody. I had a critique coming up. And I wasn't gonna show anybody, but then I had the critiques so I put in a critique. And yeah, they didn't love it. They were confused. What did they thought? What does it mean? What did you do? What in the world are you doing? Yeah, graduate school was really interesting for me. But it taught me to believe in my own vision. You know, that moment and moments like those made me realize that a lot of the A lot of the innovative things, a lot of the most innovative things that I'm going to do are not going to be conscious. I'm going to stumble into them. That became part of your process that white. And so in the film, that particular scene, there's a story behind it. Yeah, I mean, I think there's a sort of cheat for these kinds of paintings, right? You could just not really put as much time into painting that character, right? Let's say I'm painting a portrait of you, right? And I decide. halfway through. And this is why I don't make these kinds of decisions. I'm going to whitewash this painting. Well, what I do is much detail on the eyes. If I know I'm just going to paint over it. But the truth of the matter is I never know what I'm going to do when I start. I'm kind of waiting to hear. And when I hear I go, OK, I'll go that direction. That's part of the reason why things keep changing. But in that scene, what happens is the gallery shows up on announced. and wants to celebrate because the artist's a realm, his work has just been chosen, his exhibition has been chosen, his critics pick in the New York Times, which is ironic, because we got critics pick in the New York Times. Congratulations. Thank you. And he sets her, basically, I don't want to have this conversation right now. You see, when you're in a studio working, that's like prior to time. And that's that kind of introspective, quiet space. And somebody coming in at the wrong moment can be completely destructive, can take you off completely. And also, if the person doesn't know your process, then And this always happens, people are so well-meaning, they come in and they see something, and they say something like, oh my God it's perfect. Don't take another stroke. And I actually don't ever want to hear that. Don't come to my studio talking about that's perfect. Yes. Please. because I don't want to spend the time that it takes me to push your voice out of my head in order to get back into the painting and do what the painting is telling me to do. I'm not trying to hear you. That's what happens in the film. And so he's not having, he's like, I don't even want to have this conversation right now. And she leaves and then he wakes up in the middle of the night and comes into his studio and it hits him what needs to happen, what needs to be done. that painting is in the film, but that painting is my painting. Yes. And that painting that painting is these three boys, as you said, sitting on this fence. And I took that photograph when I went back to Michigan. And I was in my old neighborhood and my nephews and cousins were on this fence. And it reminded me of my three cousins, Jermaine, Jonathan, and Jason. My home, when I left, and my third cousins, they all ended up in prison. And, um, in Germain died in prison. I'm sorry. So when she comes in talking about, this is perfect. This is perfect. Don't do anything to it. It's like, lady, you have no idea. So, that's the challenge of having a practice where you trying to understand your place in the world better by mining your experiences. It means sort of necessary vulnerability. And you put the work into the world. And at that point you don't have any control over how it's interpreted. And if you believe you do your wrong and you should let go of that. And so there's just a gap between the process and the places where these things are shown or seen. And that is part of the reason why the film is what the film is. Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is artist and filmmaker Titus Kafar. We're talking about his new movie, exhibiting forgiveness will continue our conversation after short break. This is fresh air. This is Fresh Air, and today I'm talking to Titus Kofar about his directorial debut, a new movie based on his life titled Exhibiting Forgiveness. It's about a painter who is battling with the trauma of his youth, the abandonment of his father, and the final days of his Ailing Mother. Titus Kofar is an acclaimed painter known for his innovative and thought-provoking works that challenged traditional historical narratives and representations. There seems to be this delicate balance that is like extreme admiration and almost like hostility. I don't know the right adjective for it between the artist and the buyer because there is actually a scene in the movie where you're at or the character who portrays a version of you is at a showing. It's at the end of the film and there's this admiring guy who's bought a bunch of his paintings and says like it's right over it's in my bedroom you know and um the character is that is portraying you is staring at a picture of is deceased mother portrait And that's what you're talking about here, it's like, there seems to be this gap in this space between those two things. What is the thing that would close that gap because you all both need each other? I mean, I think that scene is one experience, it's not all of them. I think the thing that gives me hope is the positive experiences I have with people who collect my work. I have this friend, his name is Eric Barkley. He became a friend because he started collecting my work. And my paintings exist in his house. I was giving, I did a screening at the More House, not too long ago. And his son was in the audience. Eric's son was in the audience. And I realize that my painting has been a witness to his becoming the man that he is. That feels like special. And those are the kinds of experiences that I love. We go in the studio and we make the things for the reason that we make them. And as I say, we go out into the world. I had an experience with my first exhibition in New York. It was a free-man-bending gallery. And I had made this painting of this woman. And her face was kind of blurred. It was based on this 1800s portrait. But her hands, I painted her hands, almost hyper real. You could see the veins inside of her hands. And I got to the exhibition, the opening. It was very much like it was in the film. And there was this woman who was standing at front of that painting. And I walked by her, didn't say anything, and she was there staring intently. Went around, took my pictures, did all the stuff. And then at the end of the exhibition, she was still in front of that painting. I walked up to her and I was like, you've been in front of the space for a long time. Do you like this painting? And she didn't turn to me. She was still staring at the painting and she said, you know, my mother died recently. And I feel like I'm losing her face in my memory. But I can't forget her hand. She was a laborer and like her hands were so strong. And I feel like this this painting is about my mother. And I mean, do you think for one moment I care what I was thinking when I was in the studio making that? Doesn't matter. Like, we connected on a human moment. I made something that like felt like it expressed your experience, your lived experience in the world. That's a gift. Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is artist and filmmaker Titus Kafar. We're talking about his new movie, exhibiting forgiveness. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is fresh air. This is Fresh Air, and today I'm talking to Titus Kofar about his directorial debut, a new movie based on his life titled Exhibiting Forgiveness. It's about a painter who is battling with the trauma of his youth, the abandonment of his father, and the final days of his Ailing Mother. Titus Kofar is an acclaimed painter known for his innovative and thought-provoking works that challenged traditional historical narratives and representations. Your father was in your life in the early years of your life before he got deeper into drugs and other things. He was incredibly hard on you. I mean, my father was not nearly as hard on me as his father was on him. And I know that sounds like I'm offy-skating just a little bit, but I'm trying to contextualize. And as I said at the beginning, I now recognize that my father is not a villain, and I've spent so much time, as I said, as a young man, making him that in my head. But there was also, so there's a really powerful scene in the movie where you guys are working, really hard. You'd work alongside your dad, with salvage things, mullons, like you guys were doing a lot of labor. And he is riding you faster, harder, go, go, go. There's a point where you're in pain. Folks will see the movie to understand more, but you're physically in pain. And he's riding you even through that. And that became a voice in your head for a big part of your life. And that voice says what? Boy, we ain't got time for this. You need to get to work. Stop playing and get to work. Push. And nobody gonna help you. That voice is like, that's what I'm saying. It's like, yeah, my father pushed me hard. I don't know that I would be here if he didn't. I could not say that out loud before I started working on this project. We lived on the north side and a lot of folks on the north side didn't have the traditional trash pickup. In our neighborhood, we had burning barrels. And everybody would throw their trash in the burning barrels and burn all of it. And retrospective just shocks me that that was even legal. But everybody did it. And our job was to go pick up these burning barrels. We take the burning barrels, throw them in the back of the truck and we go to the dump. And we would do it again. And that's how we made money. Or we would draw awesome bodies house, or sing on the roof. So from the age of like eight, nine, ten, I was with him. We would, that's what we were doing. And I wasn't playing. I was in a lot to play. I was work. It was work. I wish I would pretend like I didn't know how to shuffle. I wish I would be like, oh, I'm too tired for this. That wasn't That wasn't allowed. That wasn't allowed. My cousin, my cousin Jonathan, he said it this way. I don't know where he got this from, but he said, you know, you threw hurdles in front of me and I jumped over them. But I'm not giving you credit for my strong legs. And it's kind of like that. I do recognize that I have strong legs. And I do recognize that I got those strong legs from jumping over those hurdles. And I do recognize that I probably wouldn't be here without that. And now, as I have a greater context for my father's experience, for all the trauma that he went through. And the thing that he was trying to escape, you know, I want to be clear this is not a documentary, like I said, I did that. If I couldn't tell it everything, it would be a very different story if I told everything. There's this line in the film, and I think I've heard you talk about it, where you say, there's a moment of almost like reconciliation and forgiveness with your father saying, we're now in the present. I forgive you for the past, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be a part of my future. With this new lens, this new view that you have understanding the context of his life, does that change that for you? What's your relationship like now? I mean, for certain, I mean, I think, well, two things. One, I think that there is a, we use forgiveness and reconciliation as though they are synonyms. That's true. They're not synonyms. You may find yourself in a situation where you need to forgive somebody who is no longer alive. And in that case, how can there be a reconciliation? You can't do that. And so I say that because I think it's important that we recognize that forgiveness most of the time has more to do with us than to do with them. And so for me, the kind of forgiveness that this film is talking about is the kind of forgiveness that allows you to unburden yourself. And so, you know, I'm not carein' it anymore. It's too heavy. I'm done with it. You had a debt, you owe me something. You don't owe me no more. I'm good. I'm gonna let that go. And in saying that, there is freedom. There's a weight lifted off of your shoulders. The part that I think we get wrong is I think we assume that that means that you have to continue on the path with that individual. I don't think it's a good idea for us to be telling people to forgive. and reconcile, different words, when it means that they are putting themselves back in harm's way. I watch a lot of people and my family, my mother in particular, forgive people again and again and again and again and they harmed her again and again and again. I'm not telling people to do that. I'm not. including yourself with your father? No. It's not a requirement. My father is deep on his journey now and I am very hopeful that he will make it to his destination and I will be there to celebrate with him and we are in contact. But I also recognize that I needed some space from that. And so Christian Ace Myth says forgiveness requires the renegotiation of boundaries. And I don't think we think about it like that. If you grew up in the church, like I grew up in the church, you know, how many times you forgive seven times, 70, right? You smack me, I turn the other cheek. Hit me again. What? I understand that conceptually, but I think that can do damage to the psyche. Titus Gapar, thank you so much. Thank you.

And you'll get access to all of our bonus shows. We call that show off the record. In Colonel, that's enough of the B, isn't it? Alright, everybody, gather around, grab a chair, grab a beer. Let's talk some true crime. a busy, ambitious young college girl, moves into her first apartment. She is on her own. She is happy, she is social and outgoing. And she's in school, working toward her dreams of becoming a scientist. But then, in late September of 2004, someone attacked Brittany in her apartment. Dr. Maggie Zigman, Britney's mother, led the charge, looking for answers and for Britney's killer. In 2007, Maggie began the caravan to catch a killer. Still, to this day, almost 20 years later, Maggie continues to fight for her daughter and best friend, 18-year-old Britney Phillips. This is True Crime Garage. And this is the still unsolved case of Britney Phillips. Brittany Yvonne Phillips was born the parent's doctor Maggie Zignin and her husband John on October 4, 1985. Brittany has an older brother. His name is Josh. He's just one year older than Brittany. Now Brittany and Josh, they spent their early years growing up in the state of Florida and then they moved to Kentucky for a brief period of time followed by settling down in the wonderful city of Tulsa. During this migration period, Maggie and John separated. So Brittany and Josh went to live with their mom after this divorce. Brittany was a social kid. She was a big runner, and as a teen, she even did some modeling. She was also smart and very driven. Her mother says this was not just as a young adult, but her entire life. She started kindergarten a year earlier than most kids. She graduated from Tulsa Union High School in May of 2003. I believe she was only 17 when she graduated from high school. And she did her freshman year in college at her mom's alma mater, which was Eckerd College in Florida. Brittany wanted to become a scientist. She was studying chemistry on a college scholarship. So obviously, very smart, very driven. But after wrapping up her freshman year, this would be May of 2004. She decided that she was too far from home, too far from mom. She became homesick and wanted to move back to Tulsa. At the same time, that brings moving back home. Her mother is moving to another city, which is about an hour away from Tulsa. Yes, this is the city of Chandler. And this is because Maggie works as a psychologist and a women's prison. So Brittany spent a couple of months in the early summer. She's couch surfing at the home of a good friend. And then she gets a job as a waitress at an Applebee's restaurant. She decided it wasn't for her. So she decided to get another job at a waitressing at another restaurant. She decided to start taking classes at Tulsa Community College. This is in July of 2004. Brittany enrolled at Tulsa Community College full time and in August she moved into an apartment of her own. The Glenn Eagles apartment complex. This is just across the street from her old high school. So she knows the area. She's familiar with the area. It's in her comfort zone. Yeah. Her new address was 9407 East 65th Street. The complex was a cluster of several two story buildings very commonly rented to students at the community college. It was thought to be a safe neighborhood and Maggie her mother felt very comfortable with the move and with the location. And also we have her brother, Josh, he's a student at the community college as well. older brothers still nearby in case of an emergency, moms about an hour away in Chandler, and everything was setting up to be great for Brittany for 2004. Now researching this case, to do you get this feeling, I got this sense that she was very bright kid, worked very hard on academics, then she went away to school. Again, like you said, kind of out of her comfort zone. So now she's coming back, but it almost feels like in a sense that maybe she was also just burnt out a little bit. And so this was kind of a reset and Britney's life. I think you're exactly right here, Captain. It does feel like a bit of a reset. It's going back home and realizing that, look, the academic part of going to college in Florida, that wasn't an issue. It's just, many of us need to be close to our families and close to home and close to what we know. And that's what it looks like with Brittany here. Now, she is making friends rather easily with other students. at the community college, she's making friends with some of the residents at her new apartment complex. And she started casually dating a guy that that she had recently met at this time. And it said that she took this man, the young man, to meet her mom Maggie over dinner. She said that the young man seemed to be very nice, very polite, but she didn't get the vibe that the relationship was going to be a serious one, seemed a little casual. Which is a little strange to make, because I'm like if it's going to be casual, then why have the meat you're family, but maybe it was also just like happenstance where it's like, but we're good and hang out, but then I made plans with my mom and I kind of double-booked. So hey, you want to go with me to meet my mom? That's the vibe that I get because we have all of her friends saying the same thing like that Brittany did not have a steady boyfriend. So nobody seems to think that this was something that was very serious. Now to fill in the blanks of the relationship And I think the moving back home is very telling about the relationship between Brittany and her mother. But her mother refers to Brittany as her best friend. So they were very close. And now mom's living an hour away. I think you're right captain. I think mom comes home to visit with Brittany and she brings her date along as kind of a tag along for the nice dinner with mom. Right, so more of a tag along less, hey, meet my mother because this is getting serious around this same time too. We also have Brittany who is kind of reconnecting with an old boyfriend from high school. This is someone that she dated in either ninth and or tenth grade. His name is Billy. So that's what's going on in Brittany Phillips world at the time. Now, unfortunately, Brittany is going to be killed. She's our victim here this week. And there's a lot of information that we have on her case. And there's a lot of room here that still needs to be filled up with information. There's still some good number of questions involved in this case. And it's a bit of a messy case. And I think everybody will agree with that statement after we get into some of the details. Now, one thing that is was surprising to Maggie. So Maggie says that she found out after her daughter's death that Brittany was hiding something from her, which Maggie thought was strange because as I said, they were very close. And this took place about two weeks before Brittany was killed. This is when Brittany got a call from a close friend who lived in Texas. And we are in Tulsa, Oklahoma. So it's not terribly far away. The friend confided in Brittany that she had been sexually assaulted by and ex of hers and asked Brittany to come down to help her get through this traumatic period. So she goes down there and with along with another friend they drive down to Texas. They are going to console their friend and try to help her get through this very traumatic situation. Right. This is a surprise to mom because she said, Hey, I'm going down there on vacation. Right. I'm going to take a little vacation with my friend. We're going to go to South Padre Island. Now Maggie feels that Brittany wasn't honest with her because she says if had I known while why she was going down to Texas, I would have not let her go because she says I would have been too concerned about her safety. because the circumstances of the sexual assault are or were unclear at the time. Right, which is, which is understandable, but we have to remind the listeners, Brittany is not a minor. So even though her mom could have suggested, I don't want you to go, that doesn't mean that Brittany wouldn't have gone. And I also, you know, I don't think she was necessarily keeping secrets from her mother. It could be a situation as simply When something like that happens and somebody confides in you that sometimes they want you not to tell other people. Exactly. So it could be as simple as our friends said, please don't tell anybody. Yeah, I'm telling you this in confidence and until I change my mind, I'd rather it not be discussed with others openly. Now, it's believed Captain that this trip took place around September 15th. And as we've already covered, and as you just said, yes, Brittany is an adult. She's 18. She would turn 19 on October 4th. So it's we're just weeks before her 19th birthday and yes, she's already living in her own apartment. So mom might not have had the ability to completely stop her from going down there. But by September 27th, we have Brittany, she's back in Tulsa, and she's fully immersed in school at this time. She's studying chemistry. She wanted to go into pharmaceutical research. Her course load was 16 credits, so a lot of work. Now, the 27th of September, that was a Monday. She had an allergy-based sinus situation that was brewing and it sounds to me Captain like she had a lot of sinus problems. And so she's not feeling well, but she decided to go to class anyway. Now, we know she was in class that day because she pumps into her brother Josh on the campus. They talk very briefly, say hello. Now, this is going to get us to six PM on September 27. She went with a friend to an urgent care clinic. Again, this is because she's not feeling well. She toughed it out when to school that day. Now she's going to go to urgent care. Hopefully she can get some relief from this sinus problem. Right. She calls her mother Maggie at 715 that night and said that she had been waiting for 75 minutes without being seen. She was stressed out because she had an 8 p.m. class. The Maggie told her to leave. She didn't get an appointment. She didn't get to see a doctor, but said that she would schedule an appointment for later that week. So Brittany and her friend, they leave the clinic. It is known that Brittany then went to an ATM at Bank of America. She stopped at her friend's house at 51st in Memorial Drive. And then went to class on the TCC campus doing know how much that she withdrew from the ATM. That I don't know, but I'm guessing with it being a college kid. I'm guessing with it being a college kid is probably not a significant amount of money. That was that's my thought when looking into this case because you hear that she goes to the ATM and I thought well if it was a large number that law enforcement probably would know this and we probably know that information so it's it's probably really just a very nothing burger on the on the timeline. Yeah, and it's really just marking all of her movements. When you see an ATM visit, your mind goes to, okay, well, could somebody have followed her from the ATM? Now, while it's not out of the realm of possibility, keep in mind, she doesn't go from the ATM to home. She goes to the ATM, stops at a friend's house, then goes to class, and then drives a friend home after class. And she does speak to her mom, Maggie, again, on a brief phone call that night. They said, I love you the way that they always did. So nothing's out of the norm as far as mom, Maggie is concerned. Brittany was actually expected to go to Maggie's home for the weekend. So they were kind of assuring up those plans a little bit. Now, Brittany would be killed and found in her apartment. While we cannot say 100% with 100% certainty that after this phone call after dropping off her friend that she went home immediately, but it's believed by law enforcement and by Britney's family and everyone that knows her that that would have been exactly what she was doing drop off the friend. Talk to mom briefly and then she didn't go straight back to her house. And there's nothing to suggest that that is not the case. And that's backed up further by the lead detective on the case, Jeff Felton, who told the Tulsa World publication that after leaving her friend's house, it is believed Brittany got into her car and drove home. Quote, that is the last time anybody saw her. About 945 PM. We know she made it home, but she never attended any of her other classes that week. And that's that statement is important. I want everybody to make mental note of that as we go through the timeline. The 945 PM is about the last time anybody would have seen her. We know that she made it home, but she didn't attend any of her other classes that week. This is going to take us to Tuesday the 28th. Maggie didn't speak to Brittany and this is maybe of a little bit of concern. They didn't talk every day. They were very close, but but Maggie says that they spoke practically every other day if you had to break it up. Now it gets a little tricky on this Tuesday. Right, we have that statement by police, but she never attended any of her other classes that week. Now to be clear on that, it's actually a little bit murky. It's, I would say that it's unknown whether Brittany went to class on the 28th on Tuesday the 28th. So most articles, most sources here say that she missed classes on Tuesday and the detective said that as well, but What I want to be clear on here is, do we know for certain that this was actually verified with the college? One and two, anybody that's attended college knows that sometimes they take attendance, sometimes they don't have attendance records at all because when you're paying to go to school, They don't really care if you show up or not. It's not like it's not like high school where you're true and if you if you didn't attend. Yeah, it all depends on the teacher. Some teachers will tell you right away. You miss more than three classes you you're done. Yes, then other teachers will say, as long as you do your homework and as long as you take the test, you don't have to show up ever. So it's hard to tell what kind of teachers she had and also what types of classes because If you're in a class of, let's say, over 100 people is anybody going to really notice a few were there or not. So even if the, so if the teacher doesn't take attendance, yeah, you might have 100 other people in that class, but do they know her well enough to say, oh, yeah, I remember her being there on the Tuesday. And with all of that said, it seems like, so a quick breakdown. The 27th, we know she's driving home, 945 PM. That's the last time anybody saw her. Law enforcement, saying she didn't attend any of her other classes that week. Tuesday, we're saying could be a question mark if she attended any classes. But it seems like law enforcement is set on the idea that nope, she didn't go to school. On the 29th, she missed all of her classes and this date seems to be fact this is this is fact based we can say with with 100% confidence she did not attend any classes on the 29 Maggie says that she tried calling Brittany that day got no answer she left a message saying hey I'm calling to check on you can you call me she thought that maybe Brittany was just sleeping a lot because remember last time she spoke with her she wasn't feeling well and feeling So poorly that she had to go to urgent care and never got to see the doctor. Now, we do have some of Maggie's words right here. She says, quote, Tuesday the 28th, I tried calling her didn't get an answer. I left a voicemail, tried calling her on the 29th didn't get an answer again. And I left another voicemail. Maggie said that she wasn't really surprised she didn't get a hold of Brittany as she knew she had late classes. Remember we talked about her course load. And at late classes on Tuesday and that Wednesday, she just thought, you know, my daughter got busy or she doesn't feel well and she's just not calling me back. Now, just to be clear on the Monday, she goes to class. That's the day that she went to the emergency room. That's the day she talked to her mom on the phone, talking about how she's going to spend the weekend with her. And then she drops her friend off and then she goes home. That's, that you, I think he says the 27th, that's the Monday. Correct. Right. So on Tuesday, we don't know if she showed up to school. We have no record of her showing up all week. Okay, I just want to make sure I'm clear on that. Yep. And by the 29th, now mom is getting concerned. Well, this is going to take us to the 30th, which would be the Thursday. This is a friend of Brittany's who has not been named in any of the research material that I could find or any of the newspaper articles. But this is a friend who is now getting concerns saying, look, I haven't seen Brittany in a while. And I've also been attempting to get her on the phone. She's not answering my calls. and her friend saying this is very out of character and all by the way, I've not seen her on the college campus either for a few days. So now we have mom and friend who are concerned together, right? United in this concern for Brittany Phillips. And so the friend goes to the apartment. on the 30th. Decided to call her father once she got there saying hey, I met her apartment. She's not answering. I have an uneasy feeling. She's dead. No, no, she's calling her own father. Okay. And saying, Dad, what do I do? And Dad says, I'm going to call the police. So the friend's dad calls the police and request the wellness check. That's the thing you can do. Correct. Better, better safe than sorry. I wish, and a lot of these cases, you know, we have people that while I went and checked the apartment, and then I came back a couple days later. No, that's the need to do. best thing you can do is call the police there, there to protect and serve us, and this is one of the services. And don't ever feel embarrassed either because police do more of these welfare checks than the general public's aware of. This is a, this is a pretty common thing, especially when also, you know, if you talked to police officers and you asked them what they would do if a loved one wasn't responding, they would do the same thing. And what's the harm they knock on the door, Brittany answers, oh, I'm sorry I've been sick. And then you go, hey, nothing bad happened. Good. Yeah, back to work for the police. and to really kind of put the listener into the driver seat here in fully experienced the situation. So the friend shows up to the apartment, knocks on the door, hoping that her friend's going to answer, hoping that Brittany opens up the door. Oh, it's a misunderstanding. Everything's fine or I'm not feeling well decided to stay in the apartment for a few days until I feel better. That's what she's expecting. She knocks on the door, gets no answer. she checks the the door knob and she says the door is not locked. And so she turns the door knob open to the door just a little bit and then closes it because she said she got scared. So this is young woman too. This is some one of Britney's peers, one of her friends. So this is a young woman as well. She gets scared. That's why she calls her dad. Of course, now police are on the scene. They arrived at the apartment and they confirmed the doors unlocked. They go inside. They entered the apartment on the 30th at 9.59 pm, according to the police record. They find, unfortunately, find Brittany lying on the floor next to her bed. Her head is pointing toward the foot of the bed and she's deceased at this time. Do you have many details on this apartment? Is it a one bedroom? Is it a studio apartment? It's a small apartment. Yes. So she lives on the second floor for my understanding. There's apartments on the ground level and then on the second floor as well. And she is in one of the end units. So you have 16 apartments in this one building, right? There's no like shared space or common space. There's you walk up the steps to walk over to the door that you're of the apartment that you need to go to. So you have eight on one side eight on the other side. She's on one of the end units. So technically she only has one next door neighbor that makes sense. Yeah, but the nice thing is because of these apartments are so close. You possibly will have eyewitnesses or ear witnesses. Yes. Now they're going to send out a deputy to Maggie's house, remember she's living in Chandler in our way. So it's at one AM that she finds out that that her daughter's been murdered. The deputy tells her after confirming that she is Maggie Zigman. He says, you need to call the Tulsa Police, her daughter's been murdered. She finds out that Josh, her son, had already been notified by the Tulsa Police Department of his sister's death. Maggie drives straight to Tulsa, but the cops would not let her into the apartment. Brittany had already been identified by her driver's license. and remove from the apartment and off to the medical examiner's office. That is when Detective Jeff Felton tells Mom a Maggie that her daughter had been raped and murdered. All right, we are back. Cheers, mates, to the windows, to the walls. Onward and upward. Cheers to you, Colonel. Cheers to you, Captain. We do have the autopsy report here. Oh, I've been real quick. Is it, do you think it's a little fast? How quickly they removed her body and took it to get examined? Because you figure they have to, you know, do the photographs, they have to start collecting evidence. Obviously, once they remove the body, they can continue to collect evidence. But it seems a little quick to me. It does seem a little bit on the quick side. It's been about three or four hours by the time the body is removed. But I think too, a lot of that It has to do with jurisdiction. I mean, everything happens differently in every jurisdiction. But in this situation, my belief is the reason why the bodies were moved so quickly from the apartment is how she was killed. So here's some of the information from the autopsy report. The office of the chief medical examiner was notified of Brittany's death at 1245 AM on October 1st. So now we're talking to a first. We were able to review some of this report and it reflects the body was found by police and death pronounced at 2,200 hours, which is 10 p.m. Now the narrative on the autopsy report states the following. This is the medical examiner's words. I arrived at the scene which was an upstairs apartment on October 1st at approximately 145 a.m. I was led to the bedroom The bedroom door leading to an outdoor balcony was open. A used dried tampon was near the body. The body was on the floor immediately next to her bed. Her head was turned to the right and her face was congested and purple. There were numerous towels on the deceased and items of her clothing were adjacent to her. One of the towels adjacent to the right side of the bed was soaked with decomposition type fluid. She was clothed only in a shirt. I'm pulling from the report here this information because We're going to see how it will be valuable to the investigation later. But also this statement right here is interesting to me because there are a lot of other source material out there that I found that said that she was wearing more clothing than just a shirt. But from the autopsy report says she's only wearing a shirt. Rigor Mortis was minimal and very easily broken in the extremities. It was absent in the jaw. Early decomposition change included drying of the fingertips focal marbling focal bloating of the face decomposition fluid exuding from the nose and mouth and mild decomposition odor. The hands were examined in no specific trace evidence was identified. The hands were bagged and the body packaged It says medical examiner left the premises at three 15 AM. Now the cause of death was Xphyxia due to neck compression so strangulation. Right. And of course, she's going to show signs of particular hemorrhaging hemorrhages in the eyes. So it makes it sound like what they gathered in evidence as far as like her hands are concerned is that our suspect that we should be looking for is not going. He wouldn't have had injuries to him. It didn't look like she was able to put up a fight. That seems to be correct based off of that statement. The other part of this report is that there's no evidence that a literature of any type was used to paint this unsettling picture a little more in detail here. Brittany was a petite young woman. And so based off of the Emmys report here, what it looks like to me is that somebody just overpowered her, strangled her. The high-oied bone was found to be intact, but the Emmys basically saying it was obvious just by with his trained eye. that he observed these abrasions on her neck that indicates to him, this is the result of neck compression. She was unable to breathe and died because of that. Obviously, if you're law enforcement, you're going to be at her apartment, you're going to be looking for items or there, but items aren't there. You said that she was only in a t-shirt, but there's mixed reports on that. But I'm going to go with the medical examiner's report. She's in the t-shirt, but what about any jewelry or the chain? Have anything else on her when they removed the body from the crime scene? yeah so the personal effects inventory listed here we have white shirt as you mentioned this and we have white metal hoop earrings now this goes to the manner of how she was killed too she also has a white metal necklace but it was broken and the As you heard before we went to the break, unfortunately, the conclusion here is that she was raped and murdered. So we have a sexual assault that took place as well. Did they say if there was any evidence of, because sometimes with these cases, you know, the killer will make the individual take a shower beforehand or afterwards? Do we have any evidence if she did or did not do that? Well, that's an interesting angle here, because we do know that the CSI's collected 70, 70 DNA swabs from Brittany's body, looking for evidence, including under her fingernails. Now, unfortunately, the autopsy report says nothing about what was collected or found with any of those swaps. Right. So that doesn't mean that nothing was found. It just means that it's not in the report that we were able to see. Well, they probably did a rape kit as well. We do know that they did the toxicology and that came back clean. Maggie says that she was told the Brittany was raped before she was killed, but the autopsy report makes zero mention of conducting a rape kit. It does mention some external examination. Again, no evidence is listed here or no injury is listed here. And there was never any mention by police of DNA from a rape kit. Now, one article does say that evidence at the scene suggested that a sexual assault had occurred. No doubt that was because she's partially unclothed and tampon removed. The medical examiner didn't record the core body temperature even though apparently he did measure it. So I don't know why, to me, unfortunately, Captain, what appears to me is that we have a not so great report here and it may be it's that that Everything was checked. I hope, but not everything was recorded if that makes sense. Right. So if they did a rape kit, well, maybe they did. Maybe they didn't. We don't know because the report is kind of incomplete. And look, you could have a great medical exam or even could have a great medical examiner that does a thorough job, but part of doing that thorough job is doing a thorough report. Yes, especially when you have a case that's going to sit in the unsolved pile for this many years. This is something that people are going to need to reference, right? And you may not, Mr. Medical Examiner, you may not always be around to for us to reach out to with questions, and we're going to have to rely on your reports. We've seen this in other cases and we've talked about why this happens and how it makes sense. But remember the core body temperature part of this report. They don't conclude. The medical examiner does not conclude or even give an estimated time slash date of death. And I'm guessing that's based off the science or evidence or lack thereof. What we're going to have here is We're going to be relying on police to shorten that window to make that window of time as precise as it possibly can be to help us look for the person that did this, the man that did this. Based off of the information that police collect is that they narrow down the time of death to 10 p.m. on the 27th. to sometime early the next morning on the 28th. Again, that's based off of nobody sees her. Nobody talks to her after that 945 pm on the 27th. And unfortunately, Brittany was buried on what would have been her 19th birthday, October 4th, 2004. Now we got to figure out who did this. And this usually we have some suspects that are right there. The obvious suspects for you, but not so much in this case, right? Who could have done this? As we cover Brittany has no steady boyfriend. She has no known stalker or enemies. She didn't do drugs. She led a very low risk lifestyle. I'd also say that for the majority of the time if somebody has somebody in their life that is being overbearing or stalker ish that normally you tell your mom about it or tell at least some friends about it. So it is possible that she had somebody like that in her life, but I would say unlikely because no word to the mother and no word to any of her friends about it. Well, and keep in mind, she's been gone for a year, right? She's only at this location. She's only back in Tulsa for about three months. Yeah. But it doesn't kill. I actually think this makes things more complicated because if I'm law enforcement, I'm looking at this. Okay. So we don't have anybody with red flags right away going, this guy that she dated was a weirdo. We need to look into him. So you don't have these red flags right away. So you got to go. Okay. Well, who was she dating and even though they might have been casually dating we need to question them and then it makes a little bit harder because like you said she was in Florida for like a year okay who was she talking to down there was there anybody down there that she was dating that maybe if we start looking into we're going to see some red flying Well, and when you talk to everybody that knows her, you talk to friends and family, everybody in her social circle, and that doesn't lead you to a suspect, then you do your due diligence. You gotta go back to the crime scene, right? That's where you're hoping to find something pointing you to the person that did this. Now, do we know how many total units there were in this apartment complex, because I would assume, again, you gotta look at her inner circle, but you also have to, I think your inner circle becomes your community as well. And her community would be a little bit larger and a lot more people of our peers, because like you said, a lot of the people living in these apartments were going to the community college. Exactly. And so it's a large apartment complex and we'll go through some more of the details of that. I want to get us back to the crime scene and tear through that. But so we've already covered that Brittany lived in a second floor apartment at the Glen Eagle's complex. Her apartment was accessible by climbing the exterior stairs from the ground level. So you walk up the steps and then you can go to her apartment. Now, there's no exterior common area door or four year. There's no area for people to go into. Each apartment has its own entrance door, which led directly to the outside of the apartment. Now, the key thing here, one of the interesting aspects of this crime scene is police can't find any sign of force entry. So the question was, how did her attacker get into Britney's apartment? The thing that's going to possibly lead you to your suspect here is what's found at that crime scene. So we have CSI's at the scene. They uncovered some very important evidence as they were processing this apartment. They find a seamen stain that was on the sheets, like bedding. And then they find a small amount of blood. It's listed as a droplet of blood that was on one of the bedroom walls. Now, I want to be clear here because some reports vary. That droplet of blood, some reports state that it's on one of the bedroom walls. Other reports say that it was on a hall, a small hallway wall that led to the bedroom. But it shouldn't take too many tests to figure out does that blood match that Right. And that's that's one thing that they're going to work on. And yes, it does belong to the same person that deposited those fluids. Yeah. So like you were saying, if I'm law enforcement, how did this person get in? I mean, obviously, you always have the possibility that Brittany just didn't lock her doors. Yes, that's correct. So the other questions that you have here, too, was she lying in bed. when she was attacked. Was she sleeping or attempting to go to sleep that night when somebody was coming in and out of the shower or not? Well, and you know, we've also talked about this where no, so I don't, I think we can get rid of the whole shower idea. Again, it's not out of the realm of possibility, but What we do have is remember the friend that she drops off after class. Right. Police confirm with that friend that the shirt that they found when they found Brittany the shirt that she was still wearing is the shirt that she wore to class that night in the shirt that she was wearing when she dropped off her friend. And the report state that Brittany's pants were found lying on the floor next to her. So it sounds like to me either somebody gets into this apartment somehow or Is it possible you mentioned the shower idea, which I think that's interesting to examine because I kind of picture this as she's getting ready for bed. Right or not or not or not had the ability to get ready for bed completely yet. and somehow the attack goes down. And you know, Captain, it could be as simple as bad guy knocks on the door and young woman opens the door. It could it could be just that simple. But so what police are saying here is their exact words is quote, it didn't look like somebody broke in, but there were some disruption. Okay, what were the disruptions? Well, this disruption is police are saying there was evidence of a struggle in the bedroom. And it appeared to them that during this struggle, the attacker had flung Brittany against the wall. So this is the wall opposite of where her body was found. So in the bedroom, somebody pushed her or threw her into the wall. So she's attempting to fight this guy off. This is based off of marks on the wall that I presume line up with marks on her person. There have also been reports that the apartment was ransacked, but Maggie her mom says, It just might have been my messy daughter. You know, this looks to me like my messy daughter lived here, not that somebody was going through the apartment looking for something. This is the, this is the part of the case that I cannot make heads or tails of the screens. You know, the window screens? Yeah. There were four windows for that apartment. All four of these windows screens. were found inside the apartment. They were removed from the windows and inside the apartment. She could have been trying to clean them. That's what I wonder is this is situation where she took them off and cleaned the windows and just didn't put them back on yet, maybe she was going to do that the next day. Seems like a weird thing when the mom's saying, well, look, this, my daughter was a little messy, but I guess she could be a little messy and, you know, you get into this apartment, you want to clean the windows and, oh, why I'm cleaning the windows? Let me clean these screens as well. I just, like, I'm not trying to take anything away from young people, but I was 18 once, cleaning the outside of the windows of an apartment that I'm not going to keep for my the entirety of my life was way down on the list of to do items. And here's all you dirty grandpa. Well, here's the thing. So if this would make sense if somebody were to have used that as a way to get into the apartment right we've seen plenty of cases where you we have a cut window screen or window screen is removed and somebody accesses the premises through the window. Yeah, that would make sense if his on floor number one and not right number two. She's on the second floor here, the second story and all the reports that I reviewed have said that there would have been no way for somebody to climb up the exterior of the building and enter one of those. windows. And here's the other thing. If you are accessing the apartment via window, you're removing one screen. You're not removing all four to me. If I saw that, I would just start off with a thought that this is probably not what the killer used. And more likely, it was just that maybe, right now, remove them to clean the windows or maybe she's cleaning the screens herself. The other thing, too, is it's not police removing them and checking for fingerprints because it's the police that are saying we found the four screens removed and we can't sort out why that would be. The other problem here, too, is the medical examiner's report as a weird node in it that says that the French doors to Britney's balcony were open when he arrived. So the problem here, we can't sort out based off of the medical examiner's report were they left open by the killer were they left open by Brittany and somehow the killer got up to the second floor balcony and access the the apartment through these French doors that she already had open the other possibility here too would be that Look, it appears that she had laid there in that apartment for some period of time. Did they open up the doors? Did police open up those doors to air out the place a little bit before the medical examiner arrived? Here's the thing though, before we move off of these French doors, Captain, we have Maggie Burton's mom who says that when she went to go clean out the apartment, that there was some lattice work, that's on the outside of the French doors. She says that that appeared to her to be messed up is the way that she described it. But she, this is a very logical, very smart woman, Maggie. And she clarifies by saying, look, I don't know whether that was already like that or not, or if it has something to do. with how the attacker accessed the apartment. So it's worth noting here that someone could theoretically have climbed up into the balcony. We say this because we know of a specific story where, okay, so Brittany gets locked out of her apartment and she had a friend, a tall male resident friend who climbed up to her balcony goes into the apartment and then unlocks the front door. So I'm pointing, I'm just pointing that out to show a situation where the apartment renter locks himself out of the apartment and doesn't is not locking the balcony door. So if I'm law enforcement, like I said, I gotta start talking to her friends. I gotta talk to these guys that she's been seeing, even though they're casual. These are part of her inner circle, but because she lives, apartment complex that has a lot of college age students, a lot of people around the same age as her. I gotta put them into the inner circle. Then I'm also going, well, who knew about this story about her getting locked out? Is that somebody again in her inner circle that would know about this? And possibly knew that the balcony could have been a point of entrance and not to look as if you were breaking in entering, but also makes you wonder If I'm law enforcement, I'm going, okay, who's your handyman around here? How many do you have? Because they would have access as well. Yes, the apartment complex. They're going to have access to this apartment and some of their vendors would, but not in the middle of the night. The other tricky thing here too is I've seen this several times and this usually you just find this with burglary cases. But it's not terribly uncommon. So the four apartments on her side that all face the same direction, they shared an attic. together. So if you lived in apartment A, let's say it's apartment A, right? You could climb up into the hatch through the hatch, get into the attic above your apartment, and probably military crawl your way and open up the hatch and drop down into apartment B. Now we know that this is fact because the detective, he did just that. He went up into one of the hatches, crawled through and could drop down into Britain's apartment. The thing is here and the detective, he's six foot two, he's not a small guy, so it seems like most people would be able to do that. Most people would be able to fit through there. I want I question who would even know that that's a possibility, right? It would seem to me like a very short list of people would know that those addicts are all connected. So like you're saying, we handyman, maintenance person, cable guys, telephone company people, electric company HVAC people. who service the apartment complex, those are the people that I think might have some knowledge that that's even a possibility. But I do want to be clear here, we do have police saying that we looked up there and we're not finding evidence that someone had been up there, that that was how that they accessed Britney's apartment. Well, and because there's multiple crimes, again, she was murdered, but we have a rate Then to me, it's like what was the intention? Was the intention that this person wanted to rape Brittany? And then after he did so figured, well, I'll kill her to cover, you know, to try to cover my tracks, because she knew me or got too good of a look at me, you know, what was the motive here? Here's some of the options on how Brittany's killer could have access to the apartment. Brittany could have let him in. He was waiting for her when she got home. Right. Now this could be he's either already in the apartment or forced his way inside with her, you know, as she's unlocking the door. As you covered Captain, maybe he had a key somehow. We also know that the killer could have climbed up onto the balcony and access the apartment through the French doors. I'm going to remove the attic hatch in that space from our list because we have policing that they found zero evidence that that's the case. We also find unfortunately. No useful fingerprints were found in the apartment. I do like the fact that you did bring up this addict angle because if the cops weren't doing their job, if they weren't doing their two diligence, like we like to say, then they wouldn't even know this was a possibility. So just to hear that the cops seem to be looking at every angle of how somebody could have got into the apartment makes me feel a little bit better about their investigation. Oh, exactly. I believe that it's very thorough investigation that took place here. And it's fascinating to me that they seem to be looking at this through all angles, right? They're going outside the box, if you will, to come up with how did this, how did everything go down? Unfortunately, the apartment complex did not have surveillance cameras and neither did businesses in the immediate area and I'm not trying to squeeze in a plug here, but you hear us and you've heard us on the show before. One of our sponsors has been simply safe for several years and you know, I was telling someone the other day. So I have cameras on most of us have the ring doorbell camera or doorbell camera by any number of different companies or brands. But I have a camera near all of the entrances, possible entrances, and exits to my house. And so all four sides of the house have a camera on. And somebody asked me, they go, well, that makes sense. It seems a little, seems maybe a little expensive, but, you know, I got one on my front porch and I think that's probably good enough. And I said, you know, maybe it is good enough. I said, but we cover so many of these stories. We cover so many of these cases. To me, this is going to sound really dumb to the average Joe, but if something happens to me or something bad happens inside my house, Even if I'm not around, I want the bastard to be caught. And those cameras are so valuable. And we've said this when we talked about the Jennifer Cassie case and some of these other apartment cases. This took place in 2004. You know, this is not 1970, not 1980s, 2004. If you are a single individual, especially a young woman, that should be at the top of your list when you go to look at these apartments. And when you're talking to the company that's going to be renting you the apartment, what is the security like here? Yes, we know this was supposed to be a safe area. We know that this was supposed to be a, it was noted to be a safe apartment complex, but that put that at the top of your list. Do you have security cameras? Do you have security measures that have been taken? Because here in this situation, while we cannot bring this young woman back, but if we had those cameras, we might be able to see who or at least how this person gain access to her apartment. Yeah, I'm like we say all the time. I mean, an individual is attacking you, assume they're trying to kill you and fight and claw and try to do enough damage that they're going to leave behind that DNA that they can test and then again, maybe you lose the struggle, maybe you end up losing your life, but if it was me, I would want every possible way for the person to get caught. And so a lot of these apartment complexes have a common place for people to enter and exit. This one doesn't. But a lot of times you see when they don't have a common place that they at least have cameras on the parking lot, but it doesn't seem like we have evidence of that. But then it made me wonder, do we have any evidence that we could look with the school being basically across the street, because we know that they would have some cameras? No, I mean, we don't have any surveillance cameras in the area. We know the apartment complex didn't have them, and we know that the nearby businesses didn't have them. Join us back here in the garage for part two and until then be good, be kind and don't live."

        "full_text": " from W.H.Y.Y. in Philadelphia. I'm Terry Gross with Fresh Air Weekend. Today, Billy Eilish and Phineas O'Connell, the sister and brother music partners who are a global phenomenon. We'll talk about working together, becoming famous in their teens, family, how her voices changing, and how her signature baggy clothes were inspired by hip-hop. I would watch those videos, and instead of being jealous of the women who get to be around the hot men, I would be jealous of the hot men, and I wanted to be them. I wanted to dress like them, and I wanted to be able to act like them. Later, Stephen Colbert and Evie McGee Colbert, they're married. She does bits with him on a CBS late night show, and they've collaborated on a new cookbook. Well, I do get to eat what he makes, which is often delicious, always often often often. I would say often. Well, I'm experimenting. That's coming up on Fresh Air weekend. This is Fresh Air Weekend, I'm Terry Gross. My guests are Billy Eilish and Phineas O'Connell. As you probably know, they're siblings who write songs together. She sings on their albums, he produces and plays several instruments. They've been writing and recording together since she was 13 and he was 18. Considering the number of records they've broken in the last few years, they're more than popular, they're a phenomenon. Their album, when we all fall asleep, where do we go, was the second and Grammy history to win in the major categories, best record, album, song and new artist, all in the same year. Phineas was the youngest person to receive a Grammy for producer of the year, non-classical. Billy was the youngest to win two Oscars, one for the theme for the Bond film No Time to Die, and another for what was I made for from the Barbie movie. She collaborated on both songs with Phineas. They're continuing to break records, Billy was the youngest most listened to artist on Spotify this year. Their latest album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, is now nominated for six Grammys, including all the major categories. Each of its tracks reached over 150 million streams on Spotify. Finius also has an independent career as a producer and recording artist. His second solo album was recently released, called, For Cryon Out Loud. Billy spent her teen years in front of her fans and the press. In 2019, music critic John Porellis wrote in The New York Times, Eilish, age 17, has spent the last few years establishing herself as the negation of what a female teen pop star used to be. She doesn't play innocent or ingratiating or flirtatious or perky or cute. Instead, she's silent, depressive, death haunted, sly, analytical and confrontational, all without raising her voice. Let's start with a song from Hit Me Hard and Soft. This is Lamor D'Amavi, which is French for the Love of My Life. I wish you the best for the rest of your life. I felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes, but I need to confess. I told you a lie. Did I break your heart? Did I waste your time? I tried to make this for you Then you try to break mine It is an asking for a lot for an apology For making me feel like a kill If I tried to leave You said you'd never fall in love again Because of me Then you moved on Billie Eilish, Vinius O'Connell, welcome to Fresh Air. It's a pleasure to have you on the show. Billie, it strikes me, you're singing more in a fuller voice. What's changing about your voice and how you choose to use it? Well, we started making music when I was about 13. And as most 13 year olds, I had not grown into my body and my voice and all the things that you age into as a human. And I always, it's funny when things like that happen at a young age, you kind of have this idea that that's how things are going to be forever. And so in my mind, at the time, my voice was going to sound like did then forever I thought it was going to be soft and my range wasn't going to be like very big and I wasn't ever going to be able to belt and I wasn't ever going to be able to have much of a chest mix in my voice and you know, I spent many years touring and singing and doing shows and my voice matured and started to change and in the making of hit me hard and soft I started working with a singing teacher which I hadn't done since I was a kid in my choir and I kind of always felt hesitant to and kind of embarrassed to somehow and it completely has just honestly changed my life and I mean I've just my voice has just gotten you know ten times better in the last two years and what's amazing is it's just going to keep getting better. did you want to do a whispering voice? Was that like a style choice or just like, that's the where you're voice? No, that's just how I sang. That's what's funny about it. I just, you know, I was like, I couldn't really do much else. Like, I didn't have the range. I didn't have the strength in my vocal cords and my breathing, you know? And think about, you know, how your voice sounded when you were a kid opposed to now. It's a completely different thing. Yeah. And Finias, I assume you do the arrangements. Yeah, like the production and the instrument arrangement. I would say that I do plenty of it, but Billy is deeply involved, and I would say that as time has gone on Billy has become more knowledgeable and articulate about what she likes and what she doesn't in instrumental arrangement and production and vocal arrangement. So we're either brainstorming stuff together or at the very least, she's reacting to what I do in a kind of a, I like that, go further. I'm not crazy about that, take that out, kind of a sense if that makes sense. I want to play a track because I like the instrumentation, the arrangement so much, and it's called the diner. So Phenus, do you want to say a little bit about the instrumental track of this? The diner is a slight anomaly in terms of the way that Billy and I most commonly work. I would say the way that we most commonly work is I sit down with a guitar or I sit down with a piano and I play chords and Billy sings melodies and we come up with lyrics and melodies together over top chords. In the case of the diner, on my own, I had made what became most of the instrumental of the diner. I'd been sitting around one day playing that sort of... sampled rearticulated horn thing that you take kind of a one track of a horn being played and then you load it on to a keyboard and the horn is then chromatic on the keyboard and you play the boop boop boop boop boop that's me playing piano but through a horn sample and then I programmed Uh, drum samples and then base samples. Um, or I guess not base samples, but base synthesizers over top of that. And I presented it to Billy and then she rift, you know, these super menacing cool lyrics over top of it. So let's hear the diner. That was the diner from the new Billie Eilish album. Hit me hard and soft and my guess are Billie Eilish and Phineas. Phineas you're not on all of the current tour that Billie is on and you've just released a second solo album. Does that have significant meaning in terms of the nature of your music partnership? Well, I think if I go back to the kind of Genesis of this, first of all, we lived together. We both lived at home with our parents when we started making music. I was 18 and I believe it was 13. And over the ensuing years, even after I moved out into my own place as a 21 year old, we still made most of the music in the bedroom in my childhood home. And as time went on and Billy's tour became A more and more heavy lift, she started to need to be more kind of diligent about how much vocal rest and physical rest she was getting on the road, which meant that we were making less music on the road. And the sort of turn of the tide there was that we would come off the road and had made nothing new. and then we'd kind of have a detox at home where we would, you know, have just spent every day together for several months and we'd kind of chill out and then we'd sort of reconvene and start making new music and then we'd go back out on the road. And so it just became a kind of a version of like, wow, this is this is going to dominate every minute of my life. And I feel that I'm really not the, you know, best pianist, guitarist, Back up singer accompanist for Billy, you know, that's not the thing that is my sort of special skill there. My special skill is being able to write and record songs with her. And so if I'm picking between the two and I have other stuff on my plate, I'll pick making the album every time. But can you talk a little bit about when you were a teenager? And you had all these teenage teenagers, especially teenage girls, as such dedicated fans, what was it like for you to grow up? as a teenage star with so many teenage listeners, kind of idolizing you. And then judging from what I've seen and read about you, you've been kind of insecure about yourself, not necessarily of your music, but, you know, for any insecurity you have to have all these people turning you into an idol must have been, well, maybe was a little disorienting. Definitely I think though Honestly even though it was a lot for a young brain and body to deal with in a way the fact that I was a teenager and they were all so teenagers somehow felt less kind of I don't know I felt I think I just felt so connected to them because we were all the same age and I you know I think it can be really hard when you're an adult and you have fans that are children to you or, you know, way older than you. I think that it, I think that something about us all kind of feeling like we were growing up together was like honestly comforting to me and also I didn't really have many friends for a couple years, and you were homeschooled, so it's not like you were hanging out in the school yard or in the classrooms with your peers. Well, so this is what's interesting is we were home school, we didn't go to school, but if any of us and I both had so many friends growing up and we did so many things and there was no shortage of friends, there was no shortage of activities and things to do, which I think can be surprising for people to hear, because they kind of think like, well then how did you meet them? And we had all sorts of things we did. part of a choir and I was in the dance company and I we did aerial arts and I wrote horses and I did gymnastics and I acted and finished acted and I was in a you know there were so many things that were social for us and honestly when I became famous at 14 It was not a good time in terms of like keeping friendships. I think when you're 14, that's kind of an age where friendships are already kind of rocky. And also all my friends did go to school. So like they were all going to high school. And suddenly I had no way of relating to anyone. And I kind of lost all my friends, and I maintained a couple, but those were really challenging to keep even still. And so for those few years of becoming this enormous superstar, I was kind of feeling like, wait, what the hell is the point? I don't have any friends, and I don't have like, like, I'm losing all the things that I love so deeply in all the people that I love. And so in a way, the fans kind of saved me in that way because they were my age and I felt like they were the only kind of friends I had for a while. My guests are Billy, Irish, and Finius. Their latest album is called, Hit Me Hard and Soft. We'll be back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is Fresh Air Weekend. This is Fresh Air Weekend, I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Billy Eilish and Phineas O'Connell, their brother and sister, and songwriting and performing partners, and their new album is called Hit Me Hard and Soft. Finish was it been like for you, especially early on when Billy was very young and you were still in your teens, your late teens. What was it like for you to have an audience dominated by teenage girls when you're a guy, and you're also older, you know, four or five years older than Billy? Yeah, I'm four years older, so I would say that I didn't have much of a kind of feeling one way or the other about the age or gender of the predominant audience, I had a real sense of gratitude for their enthusiasm. And the audience that was coming to the shows, the Billy was playing, couldn't have been more engaged and enthusiastic. Billy ever that some girls or young women in the audience are throwing their bras onto the stage and you perform. How often does that happen? Do you have any idea how that started? I mean, that's like a classic. Well, it used to be panties that women would throw at male stars. Right. Well, it's funny. I always envy that. I remember watching videos of men performing, whoever they may be and people throwing bras and underwear. And I always thought, it's so awesome. It's so sick, so powerful. I always was just jealous of that and I remember when I was first doing shows. You know, fans throw all sorts of things on stage. They throw gifts and presents and different flags of different kinds. And honestly, like right away people started throwing bras when we were all me and the audience 16. And I loved it. I really did. You know, I spent many years having a lot of Not gender dysphoria about my own gender, but I think a lot of women go through the feeling of, you know, just envying men in any kind of way, one way or the other. And for me, I would watch videos of different male performers on stage and just feel this deep sadness in my body that I'll never be able to take my shirt off on stage and run around and not try very hard and like you know just jump around on stage and that's enough and you know have enough energy from just myself with no backup dancers and know you know huge stage production and the crowd will still love me and that's just like only a man can do that and because of that I think more than almost anything else in my career I was very very very determined to kind of prove that thought wrong. And I really did. I really feel like I did. I didn't like the kind of pop girl, Liatard, you know, backup dancers, hair done thing. I didn't like that for me. I liked it for other people, but that didn't resonate with me. I never saw myself in those people. Honestly, I never saw myself in any women that I saw on stage, but I did see myself in the men that I saw on stage. And I thought that was unfair. And so I did everything that I could to kind of try to break that within myself and the industry. But you know, on a related note, you often dress, you know, on videos and in performance on stage in really baggy clothes. And I was thinking, like, since you grew up with a lot of hip hop, you know, in a lot of hip hop performances on stage and in videos, the dancers or the women in the videos are usually dressed, and especially earlier in the period when you were growing up, or dressed in, like, really tight and scanty kind of clothes and the men wearing like baggy hoodies and pants that are so baggy they're like falling down. And in that sense, did you take your cue from the men in help hop in terms of dress as opposed to the women? Yes, exactly correct. I would watch those videos and instead of being jealous of the women who get to be around the hot men, I would be jealous of the hot men and I wanted to be them. And I wanted to dress like them and I wanted to be able to act like them and to be fair. I had all sorts of women that I looked up to and artists that I, you know, are the reason that I am who I am, and also I wouldn't have been able, even if I felt the way I did, I wouldn't have been able to achieve it, had it not been for the incredibly powerful, strong, willed women artists and people in the public eye that came before me that made it possible for me. My favorite singers are all kind of old jazz singers that I've always looked up to and I'm always forcing people to watch videos of elephant sterile singing live and Julie London singing live and you know Sarah Vaughn and Nancy Wilson and all these people We were watching these videos and every single one, of course, because of that period of time, they're all wearing tight, corseted, maybe dresses with their hair done. But they couldn't just not do that. That's part of how things were then. And so thank God that those women came before me, because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do anything. Finish you have a new album and I want to play a song from that. So I want to end with family feud because your family is so important to you both and the way you still operate as a family because I think your parents are often touring with you or at least they used to. So this is your song, Pheneas, it's from your new album. Do you want to just say a couple of words about writing it? Sure, we had just finished making Billy's album, and it was about to come out. And I knew that this multi-year world tour was on the horizon for her, and then I wouldn't be on it. I was just sort of thinking about my relationship with her, and how kind of public our family had become. And she's a public figure. I'm a lesser public figure. There's a lot of attention and judgment paid to us both, and especially to Billy, and just sort of a rumination on that. Billy Eilish, Phineas O'Connell, thank you both so much. I really appreciate you coming on our show, and good luck with the rest of your tour. Thank you so much for having us. Thanks so much Terry. Moment and out of time, the two of us are grown ups now. Pepper had to be put down. Hard to take, hard to roll, not hard to break a collarbone. A little ain't but not alone. And you're only twenty-two And the world is watching you Judging everything you do Just a house and just a room Just a handful of bones Just another afternoon Just the way When it's just the two of us, sleep all day, I'll wake you up. When it's just the two of us. That's family feud from Phineas' new album for Cryon Out Loud. Billy Eilish and Phineas' latest album together is called Hit Me Hard and Soft. My next guests are Stephen Colbert and Evie McGee Colbert. Their partners in their marriage, as well as in their production company, and she makes regular appearances on his CBS show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. During the COVID lockdown, when he hosted The Late Show from their home, she was his partner on the show, acting as a producer, sound engineer, and serving as an audience of one. I left hearing her laughing at his jokes. They're typically not partners in the kitchen because they have different approaches to cooking, but now they have a new cookbook they co-authored with the great title, Does this taste funny? Recipes are family loves. Shrimp are well represented in the book, because Stephen and Evie grew up in coastal South Carolina where they still have a home. Each recipe in the book is preceded by the story behind it, and memories associated with it, so you actually learn about Stephen and Evie as you read the recipes. If you watch Colbert show, you know he likes a good drink. The book has a whole chapter on drinks. Each episode of the late show opens with a monologue, typically satirizing a major event in the news. Colbert doesn't pull his punches, especially when it comes to threats against democracy. Steven, every welcome to fresh air. It's such a pleasure to have you back on the show, Steven, and to talk to you, every, um, thank you. I'm so excited to be here. It's been too long. Oh, yeah. It's so first question to you, Steven. How do you find time to cook? I can't believe that you find time. I don't have time to cook. And I don't have half the job that you do. I make like, um, let's then heat roasted chicken. It's relaxing for me. That's what I want to do. On a Saturday afternoon, if I've got a moment and I've got it to myself, especially if there's a farmer's market in town or something like that, I want to go get a pork belly and just start marinating that or start, you know, you know what? I've got some brioche. You've got eggs. I've never done an almond bread pudding before. Let's try that with me with the crispy top. Oh, I'll make a cartouche on the top and sort of steam it in a badmary first. Then I'll take it off and oh, what about a bourbon caramel? So it like I get and and I don't what drives epic crazy sometimes is that then I don't eat it. Yeah, you're not cooking to make food for yourself. You're just cooking to make a process. Right. I just love process. I love one thing becoming another thing. Well, it's kind of like doing the show. You get there in the morning and there's, I don't know, maybe nine stories that are generally dominating the conversation over the last 24 hours. We have good pitches on six of them and three of them then dominate the monologue because we've boiled it all down. We've taken, that's why like the show chopped because they take You have these baskets at the beginning of the show where there's like, you have octopus and licorice and you have smoked salt here, making an entree or whatever. That's what doing the show is like. And kind of you have to love process to do a show on a daily basis. And that's related to food for me. One thing becomes another thing with a little care, a little love, and a little imagination. And I find it incredibly smoothing. I'm smoothing. It's also smoothing. It's also blotting, but it's also incredibly soothing to me. And then I'll just try to go give the food away. So, Evie, if Coke bears doing all this cooking, but doesn't eat it, do you get to eat it? And do you do a lot of the cooking that you actually both eat? Well, I do get to eat what he makes, which is often delicious, always often often. I would say often. Well, I'm experimenting. I'm imagining what it's going to be like, and you know, it doesn't work. Things don't always work out, Terry. When I was growing up, my mother wasn't much of a cook, but you had two like fantastic dishes that she made. I always look forward to those. But Monday nights, I'd almost be in tears, because Mondays are bad enough when you're going to school. Yeah. And she'd sometimes make Braille Maccaro, which is a very bitter fish, especially when you had, yeah, with like canned string beans. Oh God. I know. And let us with no dressing on it. Sure. And I didn't really be in tears. Later in the week, the food got better. So I'm wondering with each of you, the recipes in your book look absolutely sumptuous. But were there meals that you had that nearly brought you to tears when you were growing up? Oh my god. Yes. When I was a kid, my, you know, again, 11 kids and, um, and also Catholic, so, you know, no, no meat on Fridays, we had so many Mrs. Paul's or like Gorton's fish sticks. I think it was Mrs. Paul's fish sticks growing up. And my mother, her idea of making you fancy, and I'm sure she saw this suggestion, the serving suggestion, unlike on the back of the package, with some partnership with Campbell, because it would take a can of Campbell's condensed tomato soup, and you would just heat up the condensed soup and ladle that over the fish sticks as the sauce. Oh, no, no, no water. It's wasn't added in a water. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, that's if you're making soup, not if you're making a delicious remaline. Imagine the salt content. Oh, exactly. Exactly. I'm a creature of pure sodium, by the time I was 10. But, you know, that also, this is the thing that even I, as a child who just would eat anything you'd put in front of me, spaghetti with ketchup. Oh, I had that one, so my aunt's house. Oh, my God, that we got that all that my brother's sister was like, I don't understand what's happening. But I would of course have to eat it. Every we ever brought to tears and anticipating something your mother would have been. Freakly. Well, yeah. My parents, you know, everything was was very local. So we, I think a lot of Charlestonians love this. This is Shad Row, which is really hard to get. It's, you know, the row of a Shad Fish. And I hated that. But they'd be steamed with vinegar. They would have that all the time, too. seasonally seasonally yeah yeah Stephen Colbert and every McGee Colbert have a new book called does this taste funny recipes are family loves we'll be back after a short break this is fresh air weekend This is Fresh Air Weekend, I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to our interview with Stephen Colbert and Evie McGee Colbert. They're married. She makes regular appearances on the late show with Stephen Colbert, their partners in a production company, and now they've co-authored her new cookbook called Does This Taste Funny. Recipes are family loves. Ever heard other things you had to sacrifice in your life when Steven became famous and had this kind of consuming career and you had children? Well, yeah, yeah, I think so. I mean, I decided it was, listen, I think I'm incredibly lucky to have been able to be home with our children. But Steven's hours were really long and difficult and I felt that I just wanted to be home with them when I could. So I ended up spending a lot of my time as a state-home mother, which I had never expected to do. And it was real privilege. Yeah, I think there were sacrifices. I had trained to be an actress, and I decided not to be an actress, even before we got married. But then later in life I had opportunities to do some performing, which I chose frequently not to do, because it would take me out of town. And I felt that our family needed somebody at home. I mean, I don't. And anyway, I want to suggest I ever felt cheated because it was such a privilege to be able to have the life I had. I feel incredibly lucky that I was with my children. And even though Stephen had a busy job, he wasn't gone. He just came home late. So we were always together as a family. And that's, in show business, that's super unusual. So I think we've had an incredibly lucky time, frankly, very blessed. I can't speak to your experience because that's your experience, but certainly for the business that I'm in, this is one of the more normative jobs you can have because you know where you're going and you know when you're coming home. And the hours may be long, but at least you can plan your life. Then you're going to be home. I mean, you're not, you're not, you're not in certain situations. Yeah, like shooting game of thrones. Right. Unless they want to cast me. And then to hell with all of this TV stuff, I'm a star. No, the family. We had, I had someone say to me once, Terry, that I think is so funny. When I, I guess you've been doing the late, the Colbert Poor for a year or two, Stephen, and I was sharing a book fair in our kid's school and there was an author who said that she wanted to meet me because I was Steven's wife and I remember saying to my friend, my life is just getting really weird. This is just weird. And she turned to me and said, the life you ordered has arrived. And I thought it was such a funny way but it is true. It all comes as a package, right? If you want to be a performer or if you want to be an artist and with fame comes attention comes opportunity, but also comes sacrifice of some way. You're both from prominent families, even your father died when you were 10. But before that, he had been a director of a program at the National Institute of Allergy and Refections Diseases and he worked at the National Institutes of Health. And then he, in the family, moved to South Carolina. And he became the first vice president for academic affairs at the Medical University of South Carolina. That was in 1969. And every year, father was a prominent civil litigator. He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives for three terms. He was a Democrat. Because your fathers were prominent, were you expected to be model children? Oh, that's interesting. I don't think because our, or I'll, I'll just speak for me. I don't think because of who my father was, was I expected to be a model child. I think the same, I mean, first of all, I think we're all, 11 children in the family. I think we're all held to the same standard. I, I think I had a slightly different relationship with my dad than my other brothers and sisters did because I was the last. They used to say, I can't believe Dad took you to the carnival. Like, Dad hates carnivals, or I can't believe Dad went to the beach with you or something like that, but my father had a sense that, you know, this is his last bite of the apple, and to do those fatherly things with me. Because my father died when I was young. It's not so much I was held to a standard that I had to match him, is that when your parent dies, when your young, they become Olympian, or there's something much larger than life, which, of course, is how a child sees their parent, but you never get to move beyond that. So as you get older, they also get larger. So as your view of the world or what you believe is asked of you to be an adult, at least for me, my father inflated ahead of me and became even grander in a way. If there was any standard placed on me, it was placed on me by myself. My mother was not asking me to be a certain person because of who my father was. I did it to myself because of the person I perceive my father to be. And I actually don't think I'm very far off. I think he was an extraordinary man. But I think that self imposed on my part. I'm probably on mine, too, actually. I mean, I was lucky enough to have had my father for a long time. He just passed away this past April. And at his funeral when I delivered the ulogy, I mentioned how as a little girl I used to like to put my feet in my father's footprints on the sand. And I think metaphorically, that's how I felt about him. I admired my father so much. that I always wanted to try to live up to be the person he was. And at the same for my mother, I hit the jackpock with my parents. I really love them. And I think for me, it wasn't being a model child. It was being a person who cared about the community they lived in and gave of themselves and their time to make the world a better place and whatever way they could. And my parents were both selfless community of active. They did a lot in the town of Charleston. And for me, because I wanted to know my father, even though I was robbed that ability, to move beyond the childhood view of him, because I wanted to know him. I grabbed onto the little things that I didn't know about him. For instance, my father's idea of fun was to read philosophy. would enjoy sitting down with Jacques Maritain or Leon Bluau or other French Christian humanists. And so that's what I read. I read a lot of books. I knew that he had lived a life of the mind, so that's what I wanted to do. It was important to be smart. My father was a dean at assistant dean at Yale Medical when he was 29. He was a full dean at 31. at St. Louis. And so he was this academic superstar, which I never was, but he was this academic superstar and a deep thinker. And I aspired for that in hopes of knowing him. And often it was religiously based. You know, he was Jesuit educated and my mother and my father both profoundly dedicated to their Catholic faith in different ways. My father more intellectually and my mother more sort of mystically in a way, though she also read a great deal, but more Dorothy Day. And I think I was most influenced by the little bit I knew that I used as a thread to pull on to try to understand him. Stephen, I've known about your deep faith in Catholicism since the Daily Show, when you were kind of like the religion correspondent and you had a regular feature called this week in God. This is a good machine. And you know, you still talk about religion on the late show. and you you satirized religion you satirized Catholicism you satirized the Pope so I was really surprised when the Pope invited you to the Vatican as part of a larger event I don't remember what the event was but Jim Gaffigan was there I think David Sedaris was there sure Conan was there Jimmy Fallon was there Chris Rock was there what was this about Well, first of all, if I get this back up just slightly here, I'm willing to talk about my own faith if my guests ask me about it. I don't like to proselytize. And I'll make any jokes about the Catholic Church. You know, I don't, they, they, they deserve a lot of them. And I am deeply Catholic in that it is combed into my being, but I don't know how deeply devout I am. I know people who are really deeply devout and I wouldn't want to put myself in their league. I just am in integrity Catholic, if you know what I mean. And I do love my church and I still go to church and I do have a faith. I just don't want to confuse myself with someone who was a very devoted Catholic devout. But I have become friends with Father Jim Martin over the years who sort of like the Broadway priest in New York. and he's the editor of America Magazine, and he was the chaplain of the Colbert Report on the old show, and we've become dear friends over the years. And he just wrote me one day, I actually got the email right before I went on stage at the late show one night saying, hey, the Vatican has asked me to put together a list of like 20 comedians because the Pope wants to meet some comedians, would you mind helping with that? And it was like, yeah, Sure. So I put a list together of 40 comedians. They sent me back a list of 15 or 20 something like that. They made their selects of my selection with a few of their own. And Jim Gaffkin and I called everybody on the list and we said, hey, we don't really know what this is about, but the Pope wants to meet comedians. because he thinks that comedians do something valuable in society, and he just wants to be this. Now, I thought we were going to go to Rome and hang with the Pope. I don't know why I thought that. I thought that maybe we'd like sit there and we'd have coffee or tea with the Pope, and he would ask some questions, and then we would get a photo and leave. It turns out that these were comedians from all over the world. It was from 60 countries. And the Pope had a meeting in the Apostolic Palace with us. I think altogether there was like 110 comedians and we all didn't know what was going on. And we all sat there and the Pope came in and he gave a beautiful speech about comedy that we did not understand at all, that we read later, that was about how it was in Italian. It was in Solomente and Italiano and it was about how comedy, I think, eases people's day and it is like the social lubricant and it's okay to make fun of God and the church and the Pope and all that kind of stuff. As long as you do it with a smile and there's some intention to make people feel better. And what struck me was like, you're a philosophy. She happened, like, I think so. And what struck me is, and we're in this room, which is about the size of the 16-chappel, and it's actually a rich enough haul from the 16-chappel. And it's more Rococo than it is, you know, late Renaissance. But it's beautiful. It's like you're in another 16-chappel. And we're all sitting there in our Sunday best, as it were, waiting for the pope to come in. But comedians are all iconoclasts. We're all people who have a pretty jaunty view of authority. And I know that some of the people there weren't Catholic or weren't meaningfully Catholic in the least by their own description anymore. And the minute the Pope came in, we all left to our feet, like the iconoclasm went out the door. We all just left to our feet and started plotting and screaming. I thought, wow! That's the effect the Pope has on 110 comedians like it was it was it was almost like an autonomic response because you've spent all this it's like the location It's the it's the red shoes. It's the white outfit It's all the it's all like the guys with the sashes around you the Pope's gentleman who all looked like butlers and everything we were all I was sort of shocked that we we all kind of gave into it immediately Did you get to meet the Pope when I was alive? I did. I memorized something in Italian. I went up and I said, you know, start the pottery, you know, holy father. My name is Stephen Colbert, and I am the reciting. I'm the Revoucho de Titante. I'm the reciting voice for your memoir life, because he had released a memoir of his life in the spring. And I had gotten a call from my manager to say, baby doll, you're not going to believe who wants you to do their audio book. I don't like who he was just guess I'm like I don't know Barbara Streisand no and he goes The And, and, and, and, and, and I go, does it pay? He goes, you better bully. So anyway, so he'd negotiate with the Vatican for my contract. And I read the Pope. So I just said, I read your book. You know, I thank so much. I was, I was reciting voice for your book. And he said, ah, I kind of used his hand to guide me to the side. So that was it. That's all I got. It wasn't that it was, it was very nice. And he gave me, he gave me a rosary. We all got rosaries, blessed by the Pope. I'd like you each to leave us with your favorite comfort food. Well, most of the book is comfort food. It is. There's a lot of butter. Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I mean, my favorite recipe in the book is the one that we start with, my mother's cheese biscuits, because there was sort of things that she made always. And so now when I make them, I feel like she's with me, and it makes, it's comforting. And I love them. They're wonderful to give, and they're delicious and fattening. I think comfort food should be fattening. I've got so many in there. It's probably the red rice. growing up on the coast of South Carolina, just anywhere in the South, there's so much red rice. And it has its roots in Jola-Frice of West Africa, but it's a super jammy and a little spicy and salty, and I had it almost every day growing up at Styles Point Elementary School. on Michael Drive on James Island, South Carolina, which it's still there. And there were just barrels of it being cooked every day by those lunch ladies. And I never got tired of it. And for the right before this book I actually found a way to make it based on an Alton Roman recipe. that I said, ooh, that song she's making for the pasta actually has the flavor I remember as a child from this red rice and I tried it and it worked and that was that discovery of being able to get that flavor back from my childhood. Those carefree years is what that rice gives me. When you say carefree years do you mean before your father died? Yes. Yes. Yeah, taste is powerful. It's true. I know as powerful. I think we both enjoyed that rediscovery of recipes that we'd grown up with, which we, you know, we maybe had, you know, made them in our adulthood, but not really spent time with them, the way we spent time with them writing this book. And that's what COVID did. We were back there in Charleston on that island with our families, with the people who had taught us to make these and made these for us, as we when we were a children, and with those ingredients from that field and that creek. And it was a terrible time that had in it this gift to us for us to slow down, go home and remember. And also working, it sounds like working together so closely on the show, worked out okay. Which we had been so afraid to do, or at least I had been afraid to do, because I was so nervous the first time every was on, because she wouldn't have a good time. It's actually made it to air. Her going, oh my God, she's like, you're trembling. I'm like, I'm afraid this is going to be a bad experience for you, because I'm, because I'm, I'm bossy. No, no, no. But we have had fun. You know, in this whole process has been a lot of fun. And an enormous amount of work and I just could not be more, I could not have more admiration for the people who do this for a living, because we had no idea what a huge undertaking is to do. There's a lot of detail in a cookbook. Oh my god, three years to do this. You have to be right about whether it's a teaspoon or a tablespoon. You really do it makes a difference. We're in a recipe fact checked. Yes, by life. Six ways to Sunday. He went through us. We'd make it many times and then through our niece Lucy. Our niece Lucy, with her, was fabulous. And then I'll test it everything. And then all of them, all of that were going to Chris Stiler, who was a professional test kitchen, essentially. And he would say, is this what it's supposed to look and taste like when we go, no. And then he would say that you need to rewrite this recipe. Well, I don't cook fancy things or ambitious things, but I enjoyed seeing the recipes. I enjoyed all the anecdotes, so I'm so glad we got to talk. It's just been such a pleasure and a joy to speak with you both. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. And to you, Stephen Colbert and every McGee Colbert have a new book called Does This Taste Funny? Recipes our family loves. Fresh air weekend is produced by Theresa Madden. Fresh air's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our co-host is Tonya Mosley. I'm Terry Gross."

I am ready for summer shenanigans! Let's do it! Only you! I'm gonna have fun, videos of Furb, what's it for all? Are we gonna do this again? New inventions! Shenanigans! Inators! Adventures and songs! New videos and Furb starts June 5th on Disney Channel and next day on Disney Plus on DisneyFlus.com Originally this episode aired roughly nine months ago. Shortly after it aired just a couple of hours, I had the episode pulled because of some values that didn't align with my own. And that was selfish for me, and I shouldn't have done that. Let me explain why. Last week some new developments came from psychedelic therapy, some new light. And it happened to be one of my best friends. And this individual has been blown up in Afghanistan, one of the worst car bombs that I've actually seen somebody survive. And then later on in life, he was shot in the head. Most of you have probably seen this episode. He's been on the show before. I'm not going to mention any names. Not yet. But after he was shot in the head, he survived that, by the way, obviously. He couldn't go anywhere without a cane. because he is dizzy all the time. He can't go out into sunlight without sunglasses because light sensitivity is so bad after a traumatic brain injury. He spends about half of his week in bed because he's unable to get out because the traumatic brain injury is so bad. And I've been trying to talk him into getting some type of psychedelotherapy for years. And he finally did it. And he went to Trevor Miller. from Ambio Life Sciences. I've talked about it several times on the show. Guys, do an amazing work. Well, my best friend went down there for one week. Did an eye-begining treatment and a five-dimensional DMT treatment. And when he left, he left his cane there, because he said he'd no longer needs it. The dizziness vertigo is completely gone. He was able to go outside without sunglasses, because the light sensitivity is gone. And as of right now, his brain seems to be damn near peeled. And when he told me that, I actually burst out into tears because I was so happy for him. And so the point I'm getting at is this stuff is helping people. And I think there is a lot of people that don't want this stuff to see the light a day. And it was wrong if me to pull this episode because it could have helped people. And it's going to help people. If you're struggling with things that this therapy could help, I suggest you look into it because it is helping thousands of people get the life that they once had back. And so, I want to personally say, Rick Doblin, I apologize for pulling this episode that was selfish of me and you're doing great things in the world and I hope you continue to do so. And with that being said, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, please welcome one of the leading pioneers in the psychedelic, assisted therapy space. Mr. Rick Doblin to the Sean Ryan Show. Rick Doblin. Hello, Shad. Welcome to the Sean Ryan Show. Yes, I'm so glad you like to do these things in person, too, because it is much better that way. I won't do it any other way. I love it in person. I've got to meet everybody. And we'll find out why we're doing in person here in a minute. But just a great introduction. Rick Doblin, PhD, just going to go through some of your, some of the fantastic stuff you've done throughout the years. So you're the founder and executive director of multidisciplinary action association for psychedelic studies maps, which founded in 1986. You received your doctorate in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government where you wrote your dissertation on the regulation of medical uses of psychedelics in marijuana. Your master's thesis was on a survey of oncologists about smoked marijuana versus oral THC pill in nausea control for cancer patients. You also conducted a 34-year of follow-up study with Timothy Leary's Concord Prison Experiment. You studied with Dr. Tell me if I butcher this. Stanislav Groff. You did it. That's great. He's a Czech psychiatrist who actually, when the Russians moved into Czechoslovakia in 68, he fled and then he became in charge of psychedelic research at Johns Hopkins. Interesting. Interesting. And we're among the first to be certified as a hollow, tropic, breath work practitioner. Yeah, so it's astonishing that just by hyperventilating, you can get into the states of mind that are similar to psychedelics. And so when psychedelics were criminalized, in the control substance of the act in 1970 and then we wiped out research, Stan tried to think about how can he go forward when all the tools that he had were illegal and then he studied breathing and he realized that if you do this hyperventilation in a certain kind of way, and emotionally evocative way, it feels kind of like you're tripping, and things come up from the surface. And the beauty of it is what it indicates is that this materials that happen when we take eye-begin, or take LSD, and the things that come to our mind, they don't come from the drug they come from us, and that you can do the same thing with breathing, that it's alters your chemistry, it alters the way our brain is working, but these are endogenous to us, and I think the breath work. is a tool that really demonstrates that. It's also difficult in the sense that you have to hyperventilate in order to weaken your defenses. And then when difficult material comes up, often you have to keep breathing. So it's easier in a way to just take a drug that doesn't, then you don't have to think about triggering yourself. Now you just need to open up to what's coming. But I think Stan was really the through line when psychedelics were criminalized up until sort of the beginnings of the psychedelic Renaissance several decades later when the FDA started permitting psychedelic research. So that breath work attracted most of the people that do more interested in psychedelics. This was another tool and many of the early psychedelic researchers had been trained by Stan, including myself and really. Do you do that a lot? The breath work? No, I'd rather take a drug. There's a lot of breath holds, or no, no, it's just hyperventilation. So the beautiful thing about what Stan has done with his wife Christina at the time, they developed it. Now he's prepared to forgive it. But what he realized is that there's all sorts of breathing techniques. And you could, say, breathe a certain number of times in this nostril, that nostril, breathe out of your nose, breathe into your nose. All these different ways. But the basic aspect of holotropic breath work is you just breathe faster and deeper and find your own rhythm in that way. That's all people need. So he didn't complicate it with things that he took it down to the essence. And if you just breathe faster and deeper, it changes the chemistry in your brain and it makes it so that you're more open to emotions and memories. That is fascinating. Yeah, a lot of times when people are having a panic reaction, they're hyperventilating. And he said that the classic approach in psychiatry or in psychiatric emergency rooms is when people are hyperventilating is you try to Stop it. You try to help them calm down in a way. But the approach that Stan took is let it emerge even bigger. You know, that things are coming to the surface. You're hyperventilating because you're dealing with these emotions. They're getting stronger. And instead of trying to control symptoms, what Stan said, if you let it go, you will get to the root causes. And you'll be able to resolve some of the core issues. instead of just masking it with either SSRIs or other psychiatric medicines. So that was his big insight is that this hyperventilation is a sign of somebody having a panic reaction, but the solution is not to suppress it, but to let it fully flour. And then Stad has this beautiful expression, which is the full expression of an emotion is the funeral pyre of that emotion. Okay. And what he means by that is that if you can, like even if a lot of times, I don't know if this happened to you doing your IVN trip, but sometimes you feel like it's going to last forever, and it'll never end and you're stuck. You know, so I had moments like that in my IV and trip. And so what San is saying is letting yourself feel stuck rather than rushing to run away from being stuck is the way to get on stuck. If you surrender to being stuck, the everything's in motion and the stars, everything's in motion. And if you fully open up to the moment, then it will change. And the resistance is what keeps things there. So a lot of times what PTSD is for people is that there's difficult memories, there's difficult emotions, and they feel overwhelming, but you never can get away from them. Ironically, in a way, the solution is to let it grow bigger and fully accept it and then it will change. So this idea that the full experience of an emotion is the funeral pyre of that emotion. It's part of the core philosophy of how we do psychedelic psychotherapy. It's to open up this things. That is fascinating. I would love to talk about that later, too. Your professional goal is to help develop legal context for the beneficial uses of psychedelics in marijuana. Primarily as prescription medicines, but also for personal growth for otherwise healthy people. And eventually to become a legalized, illegally licensed psychedelic therapist. Yes, so that was my goal when I was 18 years old and now I'm 69 was to become a psychedelic therapist and so I just am so lucky that this idea that I had one is 18 still makes sense now and the goals here that they point to the important strategy that we have at maps, which is there's a twofold parallel strategy. One is to medicalize psychedelics for PTSD, for depression, for anxiety, for substance abuse, for other things. But the other is to change drug policy and to make these legally available to people on their own. And if they want to do it in a religious context, that's fine. If they want to do it in a therapeutic context, that's fine. If they want to do it at a party, that's OK. It's how they want it. So it's basically somewhat of a libertarian approach to this idea that the government shouldn't be intruding in our own consciousness and how we adjust our consciousness. They should be making penalties you could say for misbehaving But to being in different states of awareness, that should be our human right. And so it also speaks to our long-term goal. So our long-term goal, which may be very long-term, is a mass mental health and a spiritualized humanity where we understand our place in the universe, and we're not destroying the environment. killing each other and so that requires this two-prong strategy that it's not just making psychedelics into medicines for people that have clinical diagnoses. It's also in a way preventative medicine. You could say for healthy people to explore their own like a vision quest when you're young or when you're contemplating death or at any point in the lifespan just for growth or joy or celebration. So I like to reframe recreational drugs as celebratory drugs. Very cool. We have, we have a lot to talk about. But before we dive in, everybody that comes on the show gets a gift. Oh, thank you. Go ahead, open it up. Oh, oh, gummy bears. Those are vigilance league gummy bears made right here in the USA. Unfortunately, there is no psychedelic effects on those. I was just looking at the ingredients, but we're looking for that. We're looking at that. Is there cannabinoids? No, it's just... It's just a good snack you can have on the way home. Oh, thank you. That's a... Okay, great. But so we connected through Trevor Miller, who gave me my first IGN experience. Thank you, Trevor, for linking us together. I've been super excited about this. And the stuff that Trevor's doing down there. It has changed a lot of lives. Mine included. I have not drank in over a year now. Well, I see how these bottles. I know I get a lot of flack for that. But because I am, I haven't drank in a year, but I don't know what else to put there. So we'll figure something out eventually. But yeah, you know, it helped me be in the moment. I haven't had any caffeine. I actually, uh, in a year, over year. Wow. I could smoke and marijuana for, right around four months. And then, um, I needed it to sleep again. But, um, uh, funny because I used marijuana to not sleep. Really? Yeah, because I get the highest, uh, THC, Sativa and they don't night I like to work with it. It makes me more creative. And so when I'm tired, I smoke about to wake up in really do work. Yeah, you're a night owl. I am a night owl. Yeah. When are you working on it? Well, last night actually I was up to like 230. So if I go to, I feel lame if I go to bed before midnight. Man, I'm in bed every night at like 8.39 o'clock, but I've got an 18 month oldies. Yeah, it's up at 4. Yeah, I just have an unending stream of emails and work to do. And, you know, at the Maps Public Benefit Corp, we now have about 130 people. That's our pharmaceutical arm at Maps, which is the nonprofit that currently owns the Public Benefit Corp. We have about 32 people or so. and there's just, we're culminating decades and decades of work. So there's so much to do and late at night is probably my favorite time because everything's quiet and I can think, you know, I'm that responding to phones and then I can sort of pick what's the most important stuff to do. Yeah. Well, I've got a lot I want to cover. We've got a short amount of time. And some of the stuff I want to cover, I definitely want to cover your MDMA studies in Iceland. Well, well, that's just starting. We're just starting to start. It hasn't started yet. I want to dive into that. And then we'll get into the mental health crisis and legalizing all this stuff. So great. But let's start. We were kind of kind of brought up Trevor. everything he everything that my journey down there has done for me and and for anybody listening his his websites in the description but I've again, so you've done I've again, I've done I've again, I'd loved to hear a little about your experience. Okay, so my one experience with I've again, and it was one of the most important experiences of my whole life, but it wasn't one that I thought, oh, I'm gonna rush to do that again. It was kind of difficult, it was very difficult, and it was in 1985, so it's a long time ago, and what was happening, maps started in 1986, and so 1984 is when I started a nonprofit before maps and that was in anticipation of the Drug Enforcement Administration trying to criminalize MDMA. So I learned about MDMA in 1982 when it was still legal and it was a drug called Adam as a therapy drug but it was just becoming ecstasy so that it was clear that during Nancy Reagan just say no in Ronald Reagan that they were going to come after it. But we had this advantage in the sense that the DEA knew about ecstasy, but they didn't know about the therapeutic use of MDMA. That had been quiet in homes. It wasn't public. The MDMA had been used more public settings, and it was starting to be sold in bars and for dances and things like that. So a bunch of advocates, first, psychedelics, and there weren't that many back then, and Albert Hoffman, who invented LSD and synthesized LSD, I've been Sasha Schilgen, who sort of the godfather of M.D. May, and all sorts of stand-graph, and others, we gathered at Esselin, which is in Bixer, California, Dick Price, who was one of the co-founders of Esselin. And so we planned how would we defend the therapeutic use of MDMA once the DEA would come to criminalize it. Right, so in 1984, they moved to try to criminalize it, and they had 38 public comment period. And basically, the 30th day around, I went into DEA headquarters with this petition signed by Harvard Psychiatrist, all sorts of people, and we had pro bono legal representation by a big DC law firm, and we were able to get this hearing. And what that meant is that we have a series of hearings and we can bring witnesses. And so there's a man called the secret chief. He's no longer alive, but his name was Leo Zaff. And so he was the one that really pioneered the medical use of MDMA. and trained hundreds of therapists. And so he was part of this group as well. And he came to me and he said, you're going to be coming up to try to be a spokesperson. You're going to be helping to represent us in DC. You're going to be going to these hearings with the DEA. And I want to give you an eye-behaving experience if you want it with the purpose is to sort of own your own shadow to Because if I go into these sort of struggles with the DEA and I'm all good and I'm demonizing them and they're all bad. I'm not going to be able to build bridges, and I'm not going to be able to really understand where they're coming from. And so it was also to help me just through my own therapy as well. If you ever feel like the modern world is wearing you down, things like EMFs, artificial light, seed oils, microplastics, chronic stress, it seems like our biology wasn't designed for these modern assaults and it's probably taking the toll on all of us.

He'd previously ceased that for me for an LSD experience mixed with harmalene, which is one of the drugs in Ayahuasca. Harmalene, harmalene. I've not heard of that one yet. Yeah, it's not as psychedelic by itself. It is somewhat. But it, so I had that experience. It was beautiful, but then he said, let's try the I-B-game, which there's an incredible book called The Secret Chief Revealed about Leo's F that's available on the map's website. And it's his story about all the different drugs and how he used them. And he helped really popularize I-B-game, also, in the United States. And so I began, I took it into a plant form, and it takes a while to have an effect. So he said, I'm going to give you LSD at the same time that I'm going to give you this I begin. Oh, man. And it was 350 micrograms of LSD, which is a pretty hefty dose of LSD. And we were playing to have a therapy session that would be like 12 hours long or more or something like that. And so we started in the morning, and I had done a whole lot of LSD in my life before then, but of course I'd never done an IP game. And so I could feel the LSD dissolving my sense of self and opening up to all these incredible energies and visualizations. And it was just very challenging, but also very theory all in a way LSD is a lot in in your your mind psilocybin is more in your body, but it also has a lot of visuals, but LSD is even more abstract in that sense. I think that's why that people would have more potentially more kind of panic reactions to LSD than to psilocybin. in some ways because you're, it's not as grounded as the psilocybin, but it's also incredible. But I could feel that I was doing well. The way I described it is that, you know, you're going in there, the peak is about three hours or so from the LSD, and I was able to pretty much be open to that. But then I felt this gradual sort of other thing coming up, which was the eye again. You could differentiate the title of the title. I could. And I think the, um, because when I sort of peaked with the LSD and it was starting to diminish in a way, the, I became was building and building and building. And what I ended up doing is feeling like, you know, so much as a stake here. And this is going to try to help me argue with the DEA to keep MDMA legal as a therapy. And I have to do the very best that I can. And so I got into kind of a familiar, negative spiral that I've had before with a bunch of my early LSD trips where I wasn't. capable. I was too scared of letting go. I mean, I was holding on. You know, this idea of your ego dissolution and opening up to whatever is there takes a lot of trust and a lot of strength and a lot of support from the outside if you can manage that. I used to do that just by myself and I didn't have therapy support or anything like that. So this was this sense that I was this rumbling in my kind of gutter old sense, but then it was that if I could just let go fully, if I didn't have fear, if I could just open up that I might get all these important insights and I might make these important changes and then I would be more effective, but I was holding myself back and I felt like, oh, then I turned into this sort of shame spiral. This is incredible, beautiful opportunity and all you need to do is let go and you can't do it. And then I would just go, I would get sick about myself and then I would throw up. And then that would give me a little bit of peace for a little bit more time. And then this swirl would start of this Again, the sense that I wasn't good enough that I should be more capable in this way. And everything so much depended on me to do that. And I was wanting myself to do more. And I just couldn't. And so it ended up this, the imagery that I had was that I was, and I'm Jewish. And so this imagery was that I was being crucified on the cross of self-perfectionism. Oh, wow. I couldn't accept the fact in a way that I was human. I had to be perfect. I had to be this kind of better than I was. And that the self-perfectionism was unreal, like I wasn't acknowledging my humanity, but also it was connected to self-hatred, the self-critical part was connected to self-hatred. And I would see that. And it just went on and on and on and on. And by the time I had nothing left to throw up, but I was still like throwing up. It was like 10, 12 hours of that. And I just couldn't get out of it. It's just this spiral. And it was clearly IBM. By this point, the LSD had pretty much gone. And we'd started in the morning. And somehow I had this other phrase that I told myself was near the evening. The stars came out and something switched in me. And I called it transcendence through exhaustion. It wasn't that I figured something out. It wasn't that I made an intellectual or emotional breakthrough or a spiritual breakthrough. I just so exhausted myself by this constant struggle that I just let go. I couldn't do it anymore. And I had this most beautiful night. like probably the most in the now moment and watching the stars and this is where I piece a bunch of things together which is that I need this self-critical part that that's the the urge towards quality. That's the vehicle towards quality. You need to be constantly checking yourself on how you could do better. But if I could separate out the self-criticism from the self-hatred, then I could even do better in my life because I would have an easier access to all the self-critical part and it wouldn't be so painful because it wasn't linked to the self-hatred. How many guys out there are worried about brain health? All we hear about is fitness. Everybody's getting ready for bikini season because springs right around the corner. I'm personally more concerned about my brain. You look around. You see all these brain diseases that are getting out of control. I'm going to take everything I can to improve the health of my brain. And I'm going to tell you about my five favorite supplements from layered superfoods that help with brain health. Alright, the first thing I do every morning is I have layered superfood creamer. It's got adaptogens and functional mushrooms, which are great for brain health. I put this in my tea tastes amazing. Who likes vegetables? Cool, me neither. That's why I take layered daily greens. Just pour it a cup, shoot it real quick. You got your daily vegetable intake. Plus, guess what? Yep, that's right. Functional mushroom extract, there's six different kinds in here. Once again, great for brain health. After greens, we got daily reds. This one doesn't actually have any functional mushrooms in it, but I can't stand beats. I think they taste like shit. And so I take one scoop of this, put it in my water, and I don't have to eat beats anymore. All right, we're winding down the day now. This is the next supplement I take. Every single night, layered sleep and recovery helps me sleep, helps me recover from my daily workout and guess what? Yep, you're right. It has mushroom extract. Guess what? It's good for your brain. And I saved the best for last. Most of you know, this my favorite supplement at Lairds is performance mushrooms. Has a ton of mushroom extract. Super, super good for your brain. Take it every single day, sometimes multiple times a day. These are my five favorite supplements from Laird Superfoods. You can go over to LairdSuperfoods.com.

Once again, layered superfoods.com, use the promo code SRS. I don't say 20%. And I sort of had to accept the fact that I'm human. And within that was also the sense that I'm going to die, partially was that I'm not immortal. So it's partially the fear of death, accepting death, accepting the nighttime is limited, accepting that I'm human. And then it was this blissful night of just acceptance, but somehow I told myself that by the morning light that the nausea would be back, that I would be back, because I still felt I just hadn't earned it, I hadn't thought my way out of it, I just exhausted myself. sure enough the sun comes up and all the sun I'm you know completely nauseous and I can't even sit up and they're supposed to be a friend to come. Yeah, so I was supposed to have a friend come and pick me up, but I couldn't even sit up. So the people that were taking care of me told him not to even come. And I spent the whole next day just lying like in a fetal position, occasionally I would go to the bathroom. They would give me a banana or something to eat. But I hardly ate anything. And it was this very disturbing, dizzy, it was horrible for a whole other day. And so then on day three, finally my friend came to pick me up. This was at somebody else's house. And when I was leaving, I finally could stand up. And I had this unusual series of experiences as we're driving. I'd never been there before. But I was like, I think I know what's around the corner. And I would describe it in a couple of times, I'd be right, really. But I had come that way to get there. So it wasn't that I was tuning it. But I think what it had done is it had cleaned out a bunch of space in my brain. This constant self-criticism, this constant self-hager, this battle in my brain, it kind of quieted that. And I think that I had more mental attention to remember all these peripheral things that had happened as I was driving to this place that I wasn't really paying attention to it, but somehow it had registered. And now I had more space in my brain. And I could somehow think, oh, I can, that's a memory I just sort of caught that out of the corner of my eye, but that might be what's next. And so ever since then, I've had a much easier relationship with this self-critical part. And when I look back and I think what are the things that really contributed to this success of maps that right now we have two successful phase three studies with MDMAsis that there be for PTSD. It's the fact that we've made millions of mistakes. We're doing stuff that I've never done before. Nobody's ever done before. We're constantly making mistakes. But we're able to learn from them. One of the things that I'm very proud of is that in our protocols are various experiments that we did, particularly in what's called phase two, which are the studies that you do to figure out what's your treatment, what's your dose, who's your patients, who doesn't work for, who doesn't work for it, in order to prepare for phase three, which is the biggest, that's where the large-scale multi-site double-line placebo-controlled studies to prove. safety and efficacy to try to get FDA approval but in phase two you're learning and we would constantly be amending our protocols with something that we learned and try something new and try to keep improving patient outcomes and so I do think that that I begin experience that one I begin experience which I I do think about more as I begin the NLSD because the I begin is what really lingered and I think changed it fundamentally that ability to separate self-hatred from self-criticism really, I think, has contributed to where we are today, because it's not as painful to think, oh, I fucked up here. I like to joke that, but I mean it, that I'm just a fuck up who just keeps trying, that persistence, and I'm comfortable making decisions. I've learned, too, that leading an organization, that a lot of times it's more important that you make a decision than it'd be the right decision. You just have to, you don't know the right decision. Just make a decision. And then you learn once you've made the decision. And if it's a wrong one, then you change course. But so I attribute so much to that, I begin experience. And then we ended up this idea of owning my own shadow. I was able to make a good relationship with some of the people from the DEA. And to just show you how amazing that was, there was one person from the DEA gene haze lip at the headquarters that was the one behind criminalizing MDMA. But there was a fellow Frank Sapienza that was the deputy, and he went to all these hearings. And he had said to Newsweek in the early 1985 that we took them totally by surprise, that the DEA only knew about ecstasy. They didn't know about the therapy to use. So when I showed up, they were taken totally by surprise. In my discussions with him and my meetings with him, I knew that he wasn't really trying to crush the therapy. He was trying to crush the recreational use. We were just collateral damage. But at least we could kind of feel like I could tell him stories about therapy and why it's important. We eventually won the lawsuit against the DEA. You did. We did. But we lost that battle because the DEA didn't have to take the recommendations of the judge. It was called an administrative law judge hearing and the administrative law judge just make recommendations. They don't compel. Okay. So when the DEA rejected the recommendation of the judge, they have to give a rationale. And so we were able to then sue them in the appeals courts where the appeals courts can tell them what to do. And we won twice again. And they kept saying to the DEA, you did it wrong, your logic is flawed. think about it again. And so they did it twice, and both times we won again. And finally, on the third time, the DEA figured out how to make the courts happy. All right. So what happened just about six months ago or so is there's a woman, Rachel Nure, who's done some articles about psychedelics for the New York Times. She's writing a book on MDMA, and she wanted to interview some of the early people from the DEA that criminalized MDMA. And I said, all right, I'll see if I can find them. So Gene Hacelip is no longer alive, but I said, maybe I can find Frank Sapienza. And so as it turned out, I found him on LinkedIn, really. He's no longer with the DEA, but he consults with pharma companies to help them reschedule drugs if they get FDA approval. Wow. So I decided to write them a letter. We need help. We have consultants that we're working in an Associates that their experts in drug abuse liability and they advise FDA and DEA and we're at the schedules. How can much control should be about the drugs? So I wrote them this message on the LinkedIn and I said, we haven't talked in 35 years. Now, we're all this way. We've got two successful phase three studies. Well, we have one successful phase three study. We're doing the second one at the time I contacted him. And I said, we're going to need some help if the second study works out to reschedule. Would you work with our team and also this woman Rachel wants to interview you for her book? So the very next day Frank wrote me back, and he said, I remember you, I remember you really well, you know, I remember this, and yes, I will be willing to help you in this effort to reschedule drugs. Wow. And I attribute that to my eye-begin experience. Really? Yeah, because this idea of I could see Frank not as the evil DEA trying to crush this beautiful therapy, MDMA. I could see him, okay, he had a job. thinks that people are hurting themselves with drugs, with party drugs, and, you know, he's trying to do that, but I think this idea of only my own shadow and being able to approach people where it's not, I'm all good and they're all bad. It made it so I had a better relationship with Frank, and I do attribute that a lot to the, I begin experience. That is fascinating. Just how it all came full circle. And you talk about the self-criticism and self-hatred. And that is actually something that I got a lot out of the eye. Because I'm a perfectionist. I'm extremely self-critical. And when it came to this, this exact, you know, my podcast, the show, it just, as soon as I got down with that, this show just exploded. And it was, I was so, so particular about every little thing, which guest is coming on. My research, I used to spend a week research in each guest, and I could only crank one of these out a month, because I was put so much time and effort into it. After the eye of the game, it was similar. I was just doing it. Just do what you want to do, quit worrying about what everybody else thinks, quit being so critical of yourself and just get in there and do what you love doing. Can you say how the eye of the game helps you to do that? Well, I didn't get a lot of visuals in the eye of the game. I had a lot of intuitive thoughts during my journey, but I don't know exactly how it happened. I kept seeing new beginnings. Like the first thing I saw down there was, was we started with this Maracas, and we were at front of a mirror. It was very ceremonial, which I really appreciate. And I, a lot of the guys that I went down with, they laid down first before they saw anything. And I was, I wasn't doing, I was like, I'm gonna see something. I came down here to dig deep and uncover some stuff and first thing that happened is my head started splitting open, like almost like a tool-up or a flower or something, it's split into. And then a new head came up. like mushroomed out of my old head. And I had talked to a therapist afterwards who kind of guided me before and helped me afterwards and me and her kind of dug into a lot of this stuff and we think that means new beginnings. And without going too deep, I was able to put a lot of past traumas away and deal with it in the moment like that. And it just really helped me. And then, could you say just more about putting past traumas away? I mean, that's so hard. And people stuck sometimes for decades. We actually had someone in our studies who had PTSD from Vietnam. Wow. And they still are able to get better. So, so, but they until that they couldn't put it away. So, how did that happen? I wish I could tell you, I don't know. I can tell you, I've, it was like, It was like going through thousands of memories. And what I saw, the visual that sticks out the most is it was almost like these TV screens, just rows of TV screens. And they were just going like that and disappearing over the horizon. Everything was black and all I could see was two rows of TV screens just going almost like the credits in Star Trek, you know, they just disappeared. And I could see all these different memories from childhood, from war, from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from my time at the agency, the SEAL teams, things with my parents, recent memories with my wife and my son, on our property. And there didn't seem to be any, they weren't organized in any certain way. It was just, It was just, it was just TV screens. It was moving past. In any time, I could see him through my peripheral, but if I tried to dive in and, and, and re-experience something like, oh, I remember that. That was, well, we got blown up and Iraq. Or I remember that. That was, been argument I had with my dad you know when I was there was memories of me like five years old coming up but nothing like I said it was just it seemed completely random and if I would try to dive in and re-experience something everything would disappear and then they would come back and so I guess I may be, I train myself to not try to control the situation and dive in and re-experience these different memories, some of them good, some of them bad, some of them because I missed somebody who's not here anymore or all kinds of stuff. If I didn't try to re-experience them then it would just keep going and keep going. I think what that was, maybe was all of my, I think it was my neural pathways open and back up and everything kind of reconnecting. Does that, does that sound, Well, I think that there is physiological correlates of what's going on psychologically, and that I begin, that there's an interesting woman who's a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins, Google Dolan. And she's done studies with MDMA in mice and shows that it releases oxytocin and that produces new neural pathways. And so she talks about this critical periods, where your brain is more fluid, and you can create new connections from the synapses, and route things in different ways. And what she's found, and this is, I think, explains a lot about the power of eye-begame, is that the longer the drug experience lasts, the longer this period afterwards, that your brain is able to make new patterns and new connections. So it's interesting about five MEO, which is so short, but it's, and I'd like to get to that too, but, you know, MDMA, Last about four, five hours, six hours, but in therapy we give half an initial dose, and then two hours later we give half the initial dose precisely to keep it longer. LSD lasts longer than psilocybin. But IVGN was the one that lasts the longest in a way, and that means that your brain is open for the integration work afterwards to repatter in your brain. So I think some of it is happening while you're under the influence vibing. That's when it's most intense, but then this integration work to solidify it afterwards, you have more period of time after vibing. So I think this idea of these new neural pathways is a really probably a very physiologically accurate way to think about it. your processing information in a different way. It's not so focused on your kind of normal way of processing. And I would also imagine, I don't know if this feels true, but there's a way where you when all these memories are coming by like in the different TV sets that you're somehow you're aware of all of them, you know, you're aware of what it is. You've kind of, I mean, I guess I go back rock, which is from, you know, just this concept that you just understand it in the instant in the way. And then when you look at it, it kind of slows it down in a way. So I think when you have all of these memories that are coming up, they are sort of being unloaded from your storage. And you're able to also accept them without the resistance. So maybe that, so I'm curious, what it was happening was your emotional tone kind of the same or was it changing with each different memory? No, it wasn't No, it wasn't, my emotions weren't really changed and I was, I, if, I remember correctly, I was pretty steady. And, and I didn't have, I didn't have a lot of emotion seeing what was passing because let's say it was something good that was passing and then something bad and then something good and that there was no pattern or anything but they were moving maybe about this pace and so as soon as you know as soon as this is here there's a new memory popping up so you didn't really have maybe there was only a couple seconds and it was oh I remember that by the time By the time that process, the next two screens are up. And so, like I kind of mentioned, it was like experiencing hundreds, maybe 1,000 memories all of once. And that wasn't the entire duration, either. There was other things that happened that I still haven't really put together. But the end result was all of the stuff that I mentioned, no drinking. I lost 11 pounds. My eye color got lighter. Yeah, it was my wife noticed it right away. She said my the whites of my eyes are wider now. So I'm to find out. I think Trevor told me that I regain his heavy metal detox as well. And so I just have nothing look good things to say, but I think everybody needs to be doing this stuff. And then my five of them, you know, way before we get to that. So how long was this experience with that? I mean, I described being like incapacitated basically the second day. How did that? Same. Same. I did. I think the I went down there with, there were three of us, Marcus Capone, which you know, was with me. And, and then a civilian, I won't say his name, because I don't know if he wants it out there. But I was last one out of the room. I was in there for over 12 hours. I think it was in there for 14 hours. Couldn't get to my room had to have somebody help me two people helping down the stairs get to my room and I was I was out the entire day still having some visuals believe it or not and then at the very end of the day actually in the evening I got up and for the first time that I can remember I was able to sit with myself and complete peace and and not feel anxiety and not feel like I should be doing something and and and it felt amazing. But in the last visual I saw was It was like a 1980s video game character walked out into the front of my head and just wave goodbye and then walked right back out. We're okay. From and I was like, interesting. And then the next day we did the five. And so that's another thing. I don't know how much benefit came from each thing, because it was a collective experience. But the five MEO DMT, I still say this to this day is the most profound experience of my life. And it was the most anxiety, the most fear I have ever felt out of 14 years being in combat zones. So what was the, because I would imagine being in combat zones, you're scared of dying. So what was more frightening than that? I was dying. It was definitely a death experience and that fear and anxiety lasted for maybe 30 seconds. You know, I know it wasn't long and then I had a breakthrough and I felt Like I was dead, and everything made perfect sense. I could feel all of the interconnectivity of energy. Yeah, for the first time in my life, I felt that I felt, and once again, I didn't do the blindfold. I could see everything. So I could see the ocean. I could see the islands, the clouds, the trees, the grass, the bugs, and I could just feel And it was an intuitive feeling. I could just, I could see the energy flowing through every, all of us, everything. And I felt the presence of friends' mind that I lost. It was just, I knew everything was going to be okay. It didn't matter what happened here. It doesn't matter what happens here. Everything that happens is supposed to happen. It was like letting go of all control and surrendering. And it was like I was rewarded for surrendering. Does that make sense? Yeah, because that's what I was trying to say. It's the resistance that is, so what we talk about, what's the difference between a bad trip and people are going about bad trips? What's the difference between a bad trip in a difficult trip? The bad trip is you're just resisting it all the time. The difficult is you're open to it and you may have things that you have to deal with that are difficult, takes them struggle. But I think that the openness to it is really what gives the gifts and the resistance is what keeps it at bay. And so it sounds like you were just very open to it. And that surrendering is then rewarded because you're open to it. But I'm also curious when you say you were dying. I'm curious in what sense did you mean you were dying? My brain was telling me you're dying. I mean, it was, it was, you know, Rick, I felt like every ounce of pain and suffering and anxiety and anger, any negative emotion, any negative, anything. I could feel this going through my veins. It felt like it was all coming out of my fingertips and my toes. It was just getting sucked out of me. Then right before I made my breakthrough, I had once again, I wasn't a visual was like an intuitive feeling, but I felt like there was all this black tar over my heart. And I can feel this black tar. melting off of my heart and when the laughs drop was off it was like a pure soul or a pure heart and and it was I opened my eyes at that point and that's I saw I remember seeing some birds fly over and and I just I knew that this is everything is beautiful. And the last piece of fear I had, I had a problem. The last thing I was having a problem letting go of was my wife and my newborn son who was only about six months old at the time. But after I hit the breakthrough, I knew it was okay to let go. And it was the most freeing experience of my entire life. What was your experience? Well, I'll say you said, but let me say, the stand graph is talked as my mentor in leading LSD expert in the world, but he's talked about how this idea of the dissolution of the ego in a way that a lot of people do feel that as if they're physically dying because we are who we think we are. And as that is kind of falling apart, We often interpret it as we're dying. And so, Stan Talk, he first, I think, was 1955 or so, was his first LSD trip. They were doing it early on in the Czech Republic and the way that he was a psychiatrist and the way that he and his psychiatric team, they would work with people with LSD a few times. They mean that they would have patients that they would give LSD. two and then they would sit with them and support them and then later after they'd done it a few times they would have their own LSD trip to help them do that better. But he saw several people that came up to this point where they felt like they were physically dying. This sense of their own identity was being dissolved in a way by the way LSD works on the brain. And so he saw that several times that they weren't really dying. He would reassure them. It's symbolic. It's not actual. But when it came time for his first LSD experience, he described that he came up to that place and he decided that he was different than everybody else because he really was dying. And that it's because he had this illness when he was young. And somehow that had changed his chemistry. This is the story told himself. somehow that had changed his chemistry. And now he was allergic or whatever, and he was really dying even though these other people weren't. It's that strong that you interpret this loss of your sense of self as dying. Interesting. And you're being born into something bigger if you can let go. Yeah. But if you resist, do people get caught in that? Oh my god. Yeah, that's a lot of my early trips were all about I couldn't let go. Even my eye began was I can't let go. I can't. trust or I don't have the strength or it takes a lot to let go. The 5 MEO is great on that regard because it's so overwhelming. You can't resist. It's just so overwhelming. So my 5 MEO experience was And again, I've only done it once, and I've been talking to a bunch of people now who are using lower doses of five MEO in vape pens and combining and sort of gradually working up to this kind of dissolution. They can adjust their doses in different ways and stand actually in Brigida. So I've said that this idea of taking MDMA And then like an hour later, so starting to experiment with the vape pins, Stan actually described that as the future of psychiatry. Because the MDMA gives the sense of safety and security, and then you can have less of that fear and anxiety as you're losing your sense of self. And you can sort of blend into the universe in a more, I'm not trying this yet. But I'm hearing more and more people that are doing that or more and more people that are starting to experiment with five MEO in these vape pens at different doses. So what my experience was was before all these vape pens and it was just, you know, just smoke out of pipe and you know, couldn't really adjust your dose and you just try to get into as much as you can. And so what I also attribute a lot of the success of maps to this five-emio experience because what it gave me was, I felt like I was just blasted into the universe and that I was kind of like in the sense of how the big bang, that there's this ability in any second to create something new. You know, we think about space as empty, but there's a way that space is sort of substrate for sort of things that can happen. So I felt like it was almost like into the center of the sun or something. I just felt that at any moment the power of creation of something out of nothing, that's accessible in any moment. And that often when I feel trapped or I feel stuck or there's something that the DEA is doing or the FDA is doing and it looks like there's no way out. you know, or unblocked in this way, that 5MEO experience has left me with the sense that I can create something new in any moment, I can create new facts, or I can bring something new, or I can reach out to somebody, that the sense that you're never really trapped, there's always this ability to create the new. And so I sort of felt like I went back to the big bang, or the moment of creation, or just this incredible outflow of energy. Wow. And that that's That's what's remained with me from that five MEO is that, you know, even as we solidify sort of into, you know, our patterns and our habits that there's always hope there's always a way for the new. There's always something dying, there's always something dying, but there's always something potentially new. And so when we did with the 5MEO 2, we had about 20 of us, and most were therapists or psychiatrists and stuff, and you often lose control of your body, and so we would have spotters. as people roll around and because they're not aware of it you're just completely out of your normal sense of self and it's incredibly fast and it was very inspirational and I think at some point maybe in the not too distant future I want to start experimenting with these vape pens but it's All of these experiences can be pretty shattering in different ways and they take time to put yourself back together. But I was just an inexperienced. I don't say exactly where, but it was a group of people. After MDMA, we're doing MDMA, I was going on the contact high, so I wasn't. But this woman did five MEO.

And she'd done it before, and it was just awestruck. I mean, she was speaking in tongues. She was just like completely overtaken by all this energy. Wow. And it was just for 10 minutes or something. Speaking in tongues, we felt like something sacred. It was something extraordinary. She was so open to all these energies. And she had kind of a similar somewhat similar to what you described just that she felt like, it's all going to be okay. And she can see that things are going to take the time that they're going to take. But she came out of it with a lot of hope. Like we will be able to accomplish these things that there will be, you know, this kind of spiritualized humanity and mass mental health. But it was this experience of her just channeling being so open to this energy running through her that it was magnificent. It was just in awe and she had all these people that were around her sort of giving her emotional support. while she was doing it. It was a beautiful ceremony and it was just extraordinary. So I think this M.D.A. based and then the five M.D.A. was something that in the future, again, Stan says it's the future of psychiatry because you get this sense that, well, all those hoxley who wrote the doors of perception, he came up with his theory about the brain and after his masculine experiences that he said, the brain is a reducing valve. So, you know, right now, if we relax, I can hear there's a little bit of kind of a hum, but we're not normally paying attention to those things, because we're paying attention to what's in front of us. And then we're paying attention. I think Abraham Maslow, you know, has this hierarchy of needs, the psychologist that helps start humanistic psychology. And then later, transpersonal psychology. So it's your survival needs, your belonging needs, your self-esteem, then self-actualization. A lot of people don't realize that near the end of his life he changed. He modified that, so self-transcendence. He said, he is really the top above self-actualization. You become your full self, but then you go beyond yourself to see that you're part of something much bigger. Wow. And so I think this five MEO, you know, facilitates this kind of self-transcendence, you know, this EU dissolution. And there's just so much opportunity, I think, if we can, as individuals and as culture, start exploring these experiences. I mean, I was just with Marcus. We had an event in Dallas a couple of days ago. And it was with Governor Rick Perry and it was about the psychedelic story. And this idea that there's bipartisan support for trying to bring these experiences so that more people can have them. And more people can do them in legal context in supportive ways. And I think there's enormous amount to be gained by that. But people have to be willing, you know, you can't force it on them. But if we can have cultural support, I think the other part I'll just say is that a lot of my early awakenings to LSD were around the time that we were sending, we meaning Americans were sending somebody to the moon. And some of the astronauts talk about the overview effect of looking back at the Earth from space. And you can be spiritualized in certain ways from that. Edgar Mitchell was one of the astronauts. He started the Institute for Noetic Studies, Noetic Meeting Direct Knowing, also looking at ESP and other kinds of telepathy and different things. Wow. It was because of his time in space. And so I think humanity, as a whole, is kind of getting more spiritualized in the sense, but there's a lot of fear and resistance in people are sort of retreating into fundamentalism in different ways. But it's something is potentially new being born, is this where we are in the universe, where we are on the planet. I think one of the amazing things about COVID was that it down side to something. I mean, the upside to something terrible, is it helped us realize how connected we all were? Yeah. And I think that's this sort of understanding of this unit of mystical state of how connected we all are. Yeah. What, what is the, what did you do the five? That was also back in 1985. You haven't done five since 1985. Right. Right. And if you don't mind me asking help, why haven't you done it again? It's scary. It's scary. Okay. I was one. I was. I was wondering if you were going to say that. I'm getting ready to do another one next month. And I think another reason why I haven't done it is more that I've been more, you know, 1982 is when I learned about MDMA. 1984 is when I worked with the first PTSD patient with MDMA. And so I think I have at least enough of the spiritual sense, that there's so much work on the human level that I need to do, both for myself, for relationships. And so I haven't been called, they have that kind of experience, but also, I've talked, I don't know if you've talked to people, but I've talked to several people who the five MEO disrupted them in major ways. Sometimes people said it was so beautiful where they went, that they were depressed to come back. Others weren't so open to it and we're stuck in this halfway place with some of these emotions. So I also feel like I'm so busy and doing so much that you need to give yourself time. If I give me so fast, I think people make a lot of misunderstandings that, oh yeah, I've got an hour free. I'll do it and then go back to life. It takes a while to integrate it and you could be, you know, like with Miami and two could be three days, it could be. So it's not a casual thing. Yeah, to do like that. Interesting. I'm curious if you don't mind me asking how routinely do you use psychedelics? Well, what I routinely use is marijuana. Okay. So marijuana is, I'd say, more like, a classic psychedelic than MDMA is. MDMA is more hard opener. It is a psychedelic, mind manifesting. So I'll do marijuana for four to five times a week, so I don't have something like that. The psychedelic experience is I try to do MDMA now once a year or so with my wife, maybe twice a year. And then every year or so to do a big psilocybin or trip like that. Although I will share hilariously that the last two big psilocybin trips I had were a mistake. In both times, I thought I was just eating chocolate. one time I was staying at a friend's house and he wasn't there and I was like it's midnight I was getting hungry I needed to I want some energy and I'm like okay so I noticed there was some chocolate in his refrigerator I'm like okay it doesn't want to melt you know it's in Southern Fitts in LA whatever and I I just ate this chocolate and then like I complete my work I'm getting everything ready I'm going to sleep I had about 10 hours before I had an appointment the next morning to go see our phase 3 MDMA PTSD site in LA. And everything's put away my back, you know, I packed my everything's put away. And then I'm right about to go to bed and I'm like, oh shit, I'm tripping. And then I was like, oh god, you never know what leads it to what? You know, and then I just thought, okay, I'm in it, you know, okay, I'll just like open up to it, and then I had this, and I knew that, you know, suicide in less like six hours, something like that, it's more of a steep drop off than LSD. LSD lingers and lingers, but when the suicide in is done, sometimes you're like, okay, now back. So I kind of felt like I would have an hour to rest after it was over before I had to go meet a bunch of people. And it was, I think there's a way in which I kind of maybe, not that I knew what I was doing, but I had had, I needed an ego reduction. I would say, I had an incredible time in LA, and I had all these meetings, and there's a book about our work called Asad Test, LSD, ecstasy, and the power to heal. It's about the lives of one of the veterans that was in our studies, Nick Blackston, and then also about my life, and then Michael Midhofer, who's the lead psychiatrist. And it's about how our lives from childhood developed and how we interacted. And so that's been option for a movie. by Vice and Participant Media. And so I had a meeting with the person that was going to be writing the script and the director earlier at that evening. And I had met a famous actor and I did other things that were extraordinary in LA. and I was kind of getting full of myself. And so during this mushroom experience that I hadn't intentionally done, I had this realization that this entire time that I was talking with this director, Jonas Rasmussen, as his name, and he made the movie flee, which was nominated for three Academy Awards, and it's about an Afghan refugee. and flee F. L. E. So, but I realized under the mushrooms that I had spent the entire time with him telling my story to him. But I hadn't asked him why he cared about telling this story. I was all ego and me. And so I felt like it was a good experience. I needed that. sort of mushroom trips that put me in my place, but I wouldn't have done it intentionally. I was just eating this chocolate. Wow. What would you say, what was your most profound psychedelic experience? Well, it's hard to say, because I've done MDMA about 130 times. I've done LSD over 100 times. I've done a lot of different things. But, well, if I had to say like, what is the most profound, it is really hard to say. But I do think about this one experience that I would say was the most mystical experience of my whole life. And it was around also around 1985. This is a big drug period. It's a great year for you. It was a great year for me. And this experience, As I said, we had started this nonprofit trader, protect the use of MDMA. And when it was legal, we were able to reach out to various people who wouldn't otherwise do an illegal drug. And one of them was a man, brother, David Steindoorost, who's in his 90s. He's a Roman Catholic monk, a mystic But he was open to trying MDMA in half dose as an aid to meditation in the monastery. He was in a monastery not far from Aslan in Big Sir and Stan Graff had brought him to be a teacher for us for a couple of days. And I got to know him and really like him and he was willing to experiment trying MDMA as an aid to meditation and found it helped them tremendously. And he actually then spoke to the media once the DEA tried to criminalize. And so it's like we're changing the narrative. The DEA said, oh, MDMA is all about ecstasy. It's all about parties. And then we got a monk saying that it helped them to deepen his meditation. We had a rabbi compared it to the Sabbath. So we're winning in the public. in the public and the court of public opinion, and we were also winning in the court. But so during this MDM experience, part of it was, I was just starting to get more public to challenge the DEA, and I was also thinking about Brother David. And I was like, so I found a camping spot, a beautiful spot at the edge of the edge of the continent. So I was right on the Pacific Ocean. I found this spot where the high tide came all around me, right the mountain behind me, but I was dry. where I was and there was big rocks and boulders out there and the waves were crashing but I had this little perch at the edge of the continent and the in big sir where it was you know there's not that much light so the stars are incredible and and so I was thinking about first off you know how do I stay safe you know and so there's this tree this big overhanging tree and I sort of imagine that was the the DEA and the police And so I was interacting in a way. And I came up with this insight that the DEA and the police, they spend a lot of time trying to find what you're trying to hide from them. They're trying to look for what's not there. And if you come up to them, directly, they have to engage so they're directly dealing with me with the lawsuit and things like that. But I felt that there was a certain safety that I was getting. It wasn't just risk. It was also trying to make me safer to confront them directly. And if I didn't give them direct clues like I'm doing this illegal stuff, which obviously I was, but if I didn't, you know, So I could confront them in this way and I felt that that anyway made me safer to speak out rather than less safe. And then I was thinking about brother David and I was like, why would somebody want to sell a bit life? What's the point of trying to be a monk? And why would you even want to do that? And so I was just thinking about that and then I was sort of relaxed about that and I was just opening my heart and opening up to the night and I just felt this enormity of the stars and the universe and the roaring of the ocean and the Pacific Ocean being so big and everything is so big and I'm so little tiny little speck and and I just had this feeling at a moment like like I could just disappear into the universe. I could let this full eco-dysolution like this enormity, but I myself am sort of gone. And after a while, I sort of realized, well, I was still there. I wasn't really gone. I'm like, well, why am I still here? I know that the Earth is spinning at thousands of miles. Everything's in motion. Why don't I just fly out into the universe? Why am I still here? Why am I atoms together? And then I had the sense that there was something that was keeping me there that was gravity, and that gravity, then I interpreted it as as a human, as a lover that I was, and it was more that I was cradled in the arms of gravity. That gravity was keeping things together. If no gravity would be all dispersed everywhere. But I felt gravity like a lover, like a, like a, and I felt that there's this love woven into everything in the universe. and this attraction of one thing to another that permits things to be built over billions of millions of years, that this kind of sense of an inherent filament of love through everything. And I felt this is why people want to be a monk in a way that you don't have a relationship for a particular person or a thing. You develop this love for the universe, this love for everything that is, and there's an advantage to being celibate in a certain way. And I felt this love of this universal gravity. And then I thought, this is great. I figured it out. Now I don't have to be celibate. But what changed from that day, and that's why I go back to that is potentially, you know, I'd say the most profound, is that it changed my sense, at the time I had no relationship, too. So I was not involved in a relationship, I was on my own, and I never was as lonely after that experience, because I would fall back to there's this loving thread throughout existence. And I think it was the most mystical sense of my whole life as well. And people talk about how, oh, you know, mysticism comes or this unitive mystical experience more from the classic psychedelics. And I have had those kind of experiences, but I think this was the one where I was both there and not there and I was a human and part of everything. And so I look back at that. Now, I had a chance 30 years later at a conference where I was that and Brother David was that. And I sat with him at dinner. And I said, then I want to explain to him the most mystical experience of my whole life because he was involved in it. And I was wondering what did he think about it? All right, so it took 30 years from me to have this conversation with him. Wow. And I explained everything. And I said, I was cradled in the arms of gravity. That was my imagery. And that's helped in so many ways. And then he was silent for a while. And then what he said was, I think about gravity every day. Really? I always said, I think about gravity every day. Yeah. So he came relate. He could totally relate. Yeah. That was, was that, did you say that was MD and that was MD and me? Interesting. Do you? So it doesn't matter to you whether it's natural or totally does not matter. So let me say that there's a romantic nature, people have. If it's from nature, it's somehow good. Everything's from nature. And even our brains are from nature, and if we put stuff together in a way it's natural, but I think it's the molecule. So, you know, LSD is incredible. I mean, but it doesn't appear in nature. There's something similar to LSD called LSA. So LSD is like surject acid, diatholimid. LSA is like surject acid, amid, and that's in morning glory seeds. And there's molecules similar to LSD and air got, but there's no LSD in nature at all. So I think this natural synthetic divide is meaningless. And the molecules are the molecules wherever they come from. And things from nature can be poisonous. and things from the laboratory can be good. MDMA itself doesn't appear in nature either, but where it matters is politics. So right now, in Oregon, there was the Oregon psilocybin initiative, and it's getting ready to be implemented, and then in November of this last year, the Colorado passed the natural plant medicines. initiative. And so we were working with the people that put that on the ballot and spent the money to get it approved. And they were doing polling to try to figure out whether it would pass or how to speak to people. And what they learned is that when you add in LSD or MDMA, suddenly it would no longer pass. That if you just say natural plant medicines, then people, oh yeah, I'm all for that. You know, okay. But you add synthetics and people have this reaction like, oh, no, you know, I'm not for that. I'm glad we're talking about this because I'm going to be honest. I'm one of them. I am. You think if it's from nature, it's better. I just, yeah, you know, I just have that mindset and I take I personally take my psychedelic journeys at very seriously. Like you were saying, I block off the time period where I'm not going to be doing anything a couple days before and a couple days after. And I want to be able to clear my head before I get into it and I'm very ceremonial. And for some reason, I'm drawn to the plants. Well, tell me what you think is the difference. I don't really know how to explain it, but I feel like I just feel like if it's natural, then God or the universe put it here for us to find. And another reason is I lost a lot of trust in the pharmaceutical companies. And so, because I lost a lot of trust in the pharmaceutical companies, to synthetics. Maybe we got pushed in, lumped in with that. Yeah. That makes any sense. Yeah, it does. I think so. I do think, well, fortunately, five MEO, we now know, does come from a toad. The venom of toad. And that's, I'd be in comes from the, they had Boga root. But I'll just say that maybe this is not a difference, but the psilocybin obviously comes from mushrooms. But all the research that's been done with psilocybin has not been psilocybin mushrooms. It's been synthetic psilocybin. Minerous. I didn't know that. All of that. So there's not been any research really with mushrooms. All that we hear about the last 20 years of all the research of a psilocybin. It's synthetic psilocybin. Now, they're making synthetic something that does appear in nature. So it's not quite, you know, a synthetic. But it's, and people are starting to say, maybe we should research the mushroom. But let's give mushroom for a second off therapy. How will that be different from the synthetic? So I've only done mushrooms. I've never had access to psilocybin in a, that was synthetically produced. So all of my mushroom experiences are only the mushrooms. And they've been profound, incredible. But my guess is that if you were to give somebody a mushroom experience, that it would be identical to the psilocybin psychologically, there are other molecules in the mushrooms that may have other medicinal properties. But I also think that there's incredible value in LSD, and it is synthetic. So I think what's more important, and I think this is the fundamental part that's wrong with our drug war, is that we've made that certain things are good or bad by themselves. like these are bad drugs, and these are okay. Like alcohol and tobacco. They're okay. They're okay. But I think it's the relationship that we have with it is what determines whether it's good or bad, or whether it's beneficial or helpful. And so we miss that by the drug war. We miss this whole idea of the relationship. And one of the best examples of that for me is the drug called felidibide. So, in the 50s and 60s, the litamide was used for morning sickness, for pregnant women, and it produced incredible, terrible birth defects. People would be born without with, with, with, tripled limbs. Oh, man. A lot of times. And this was really, um, popular as a drug by the Farmer Company in Europe. And there was, um, the saffron now to bring it into the United States. And there was this woman at the FDA that, um, and heard some of these stories that wasn't clear that these birth defects at the time were connected to the little mind, but she thought they might be, and so she blocked it from coming into the US. And she's the only person from the FDA, Francis Kelsey was her name, who ever got a presidential Medal of Honor. for blocking the lid of mine. So it was the quintessential bad drug. All right. The decade and a half or so later, the lid of mine we noticed is people noticed that it's great for certain kind of cancers. It shrinks blood cells. It shrinks blood supply to certain things. So it's now a medicine. So this horrible drug in certain contexts, pregnant women, was terrible. But in other contexts with people who are struggling with leprosy with cancer, that this drug can be very helpful. And so it's a different relationship with the same thing. And so I think it's the relationships more than is it natural, isn't synthetic. makes a lot of sense. The five of me, oh, I did, was synthetic five of me, oh, by the way. So yeah, so it's just, you weren't hurting any toes. Nope. But yeah, I'm glad that we just talked about that. I have a kind of a bigger question, so that in the psychedelics sixties, psychedelics got kind of connected to the hippies and the anti or movement, the anti-bent, and I'm more movement. You've talked about how you've been in war. So I'm wondering, has the psychedelic experiences, how have they impacted your sense about war and violence and what we're trying to accomplish, or if at all? It may be rethink everything. I think a lot of it is meaningless, senseless. stuff that we don't need to be involved in and, you know, I don't have a lot of experience with psychedelics, but my trip with Trevor, it just changed my perspective on everything. And it did, it made me rethink why we were over there, what we were doing over there, why we were there for so long. It made me had I done psychedelics prior to joining the military. They probably wouldn't have joined. Is that what you're asking? Well, in part, yeah, because I now think though that what we see with the war in Ukraine, it's so clear that there's a massive totalitarian effort to take over democracy in Ukraine so that we need a military, we need to fight in certain times, but not in others. So I guess I'm wondering, are you saying you're a pacifist now or just that there's more differentiation between, you know, when it's appropriate and when it's not? I wouldn't say a pacifist, but I'll say I think if everybody was doing this stuff, we wouldn't have any of these conflicts. And I think a lot of us will be getting along, who don't normally get along, and I don't think we would have this mental health crisis. I think a lot of hatred and a lot of anger would disappear into nothing, you know, if people gave psychedelics a chance. Would you agree with that? I do. And in fact, so when I was 18, you know, I was in despair in a way about the world. You know, and I had been, well, I was Jewish born in 53, not that long after the Holocaust. I had relatives in Israel, Palestine, since 1904, and relatives that fought in the 48 War of Independence. And so I was just raised from a very young age about the reality of the Holocaust, but I was taught it in America at the time of Americans, height of our power. So I felt that I could kind of approach the horror of that from a safe place in a way. But I was sort of told by my parents that I was part of this multigenerational story. You know, Judaism goes back, you know, you get to hear these stories of the Pharaohs and building pyramids and stuff. But I think that's more myth and reality, but still this idea that was taught to me that I was a product of refugees that came from Poland and Russia in 1880s, and in the first early part of the 20th century, from my grandparents and grandparents, they came to America for freedom, they found that they made a good life, they succeeded. And then my job was in this generational line, was to think about these deeper threats. I also was very much influenced by the Cuban Missile Crisis. So I was just a young boy, and now the whole world could blow up, and we could die, and I teach you, you know, duck and cover under your desk, you know, kids have said to say, you know, active shooter drills and stuff. But this was like, what do we do if the world blows up? And I just felt increasingly like the world was, we hadn't evolved from animals that far. You know, our rational thought was, and I was in despair. And I was also in one of the last years of the lottery for a Vietnam. And so I decided at the time that I didn't think it was a wise war. And I thought that there's multiple different ways to serve your country. And that I wasn't gonna run away to Canada or pretend I had bone spurs or something like that. But I wasn't, and I wasn't a conscientious subjector, because to be a conscientious subjector, you need to be a passiveist and against all wars. And I'm like, you know, if it was to fight against Hitler and the Germans, I would fight. I wouldn't say, you know, rely on their humanity. And so my only option I thought was to protest in some way. And so I decided that I would be a draft resistor, and I would go to jail, that I would serve my country by going to jail, and that I would drain the war machine from resources. And so I never filed for my draft card. I never sent in the first postcard to register for the draft. Now, I had a Social Security number. I was paying taxes. I had a driver's license. I was in high school. I was on the roll. It just was like the government knows where I am. And so I just assumed that I would end up going to jail. And that I studied Gandhi and Tolstoy and nonviolent resistance. And I thought that's what I would do. And that's how I would serve my country. overestimated was the efficiency of the government. So my parents talked to me and said, this is okay. You know, we understand what you're doing, but you're going to be a felon and you're never going to be my dad was a doctor. He said, you're never going to be able to be a doctor or a lawyer or Indian chief, anything like this because you are going to have this felony record. And like, okay, I will accept that. And I'll just have to figure out something else to do with my life. And as it turned out, nothing ever happened to me. Really? Nothing. Nothing. I was just like, you know, a later, about a year later after I didn't do this, I got a high lottery number, so I probably wouldn't have gone anyway. But I thought something, and later it turned out that around 60,000 people, I heard, had didn't register for the draft. And there were enough people going to the draft boards that they could prosecute the war. And they didn't do anything. And then President Carter, on his first day in office, pardoned all the draft resistors. So I had identified myself as a young boy, as a counterculture drug using criminal. But the thing was that when I first started doing LSD and I first started getting the sense that there's something beyond my biography, that it's not just the world began when I was born and it will end when I die, that there's this whole other stuff that sense of being connected in a deeper way. is the antidote to genocide and to Holocaust and nuclear war and racism and so I do feel that if people were to do these experiences in a supportive way because you could do these drugs and you could end up worse off if you're not supported. and that happens to a bunch of people, but I do feel if people could feel that beneath my tribe, beneath my religion, beneath my gender, beneath my race, beneath my nationality, were humans, beneath that were part of this web of life. And if we felt that and knew that, we wouldn't be demonizing other people so much. And I had this one experience when I was 16 to I was very interested in the other and studying the other and so I studied Russian in high school. And the Russians were in the Cold War and in horrible and so when I was 16 years old after my junior year my parents sent me to Russia. to study the language. And this was 1970. And this is the big Cold War time. And I had the impression that all these Russians hate us. And we should be hating all these Russians. And they want to kill us. And we've got all these bombs aimed at us. And I just thought, OK, it's these countries against countries. And when I got there and my parents, to their credit, they taught me this other thing, which was that there's big factors and none of us are big enough to deal with them by ourselves. But if you can do something little, you should do it. So in my little suitcase, they gave me prayer books. Jewish prayer books to bring to Russia, which were illegal at the time. And they said, if you can get these to people at a synagogue while you're there, you should do it. Because all these prayer books are illegal. And I ended up, I did. I did find the synagogue and I did give these prayer books to these guys and I made a lot of money in the black market selling stuff to young Russians who wanted to buy our clothes, blue jeans and all the stuff and the rubles were worthless outside of Russia so I went to the synagogue and said I've got all this money for you and I've got these prayer books and they said, don't give it to us now, we're under observation, but I'll meet you in a subway at this time at this place and you can do the transfer then. And I thought this is great. I'm James Bond now. But I'm 16. And I was like, hey, if they catch me, they'll just ship me home. So I had this fearless stuff. And I did. And I met the guy and did the transfer. But I realized these people didn't hate us. And it was their governments and these clashes of power people. But I mean, what? made an amazing impact on me as I was super shy. I went for a walk with a Russian girl in the beach. I'm like, you don't want to kill me. I don't kill you. I do think that the sense that we're all in it together, I do feel. So when I was 18, and I first started doing these psychedelics, I thought this could be this anecdote. It has been wiped out. So I woke up to LSD after the backlash. But I thought I have this sort of privileged life that my parents will make sure I don't starve, and I have a place shelter. And I'm supposed to do something to avoid another Holocaust. I thought maybe the psychedelics, this could be it. So that's where I focus on with that same belief that if more people could do this, that we would have a different approach to conflict. And we would have a different approach to the irrational. You know, that we would not buy into it as much and that we would try to see people. So that's why my whole life has basically been devoted to psychedelics. But I think it's important that that we say that it's for everybody. So this idea of bipartisan support and this idea that I mean, okay, so I guess this is a question for you, that you might not go on into the military at that time, but then what if people landed here in America trying to take over? than I would fight. Yeah. And I still went to this day. That's the most important. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so, yeah, I guess I'm not against, I don't know how to say this. I guess I'm not against war, but I am, again, if you don't, if you can't, if you're not defending yourself or defending somebody else, I don't really know what we're doing there anymore. And there were a lot of other things that I thought about after my experience. And it did a change, everything, everything. But back to you. Let's talk about, let's, let's, I want to go into the Iceland stuff and what you guys are going to do that out there. Okay. Well, let me say first off that our thought is to globalize it access to psychedelics and globalize access to MD Maces at therapy. So our first phase three studies We're in Israel, Canada, and the United States. So as I said, I was trained to sort of make a contribution to Israel. I thought, bring psychedelics to research in Israel. The, once we, if we do get FDA approval, it will very shortly thereafter be approved in Israel and Canada. We're also starting research in Europe. So we're trying to get approval by the European Medicines Agency. So we're doing studies in around 10 sites in seven countries in Europe. We also have had some studies in Brazil in Australia in other places. And so this idea of sort of a global community So what happened in Iceland is just recently in January of this year, actually, there was the first psychedelic conference in Iceland. And researchers from around the world were invited to speak, and I was one of the ones that was invited to speak. It was very well received and it was the whole community. Iceland is only about 380,000 people. And so the conference was well-covered in all of their media on TV and in magazines and newspapers and so a lot of people heard about it and many people from the government came to the conference. from the Prime Minister's office, from the Minister of the Department of Justice, from the Department of Public Health, a lot of these people came to the conference. And so one of the things that's been hard for me, I would say, is that I have perceived of the police as the predator and I'm the prey. just because of the drug war. And so there was this again, seeing through these kind of things, I realized that I now have my nephew as a police officer. My sister's son is a police officer in Washington, D.C. Oh. And so we decided that we would try to reach out to the police. The police have one of the most traumatic jobs you could imagine. Absolutely. And a lot of times veterans have preferential hiring as the police. And so you could be traumatized before you get into military, traumatized in the military, and then you get a trauma-inducing job. And so I think the police are under enormous stress. And as part of this sort of trying to show, it's healing for all. And I gave a talk. We arranged to give a talk at the International Association of the Chiefs of Police. And it was exactly, you'll see how this relates to Iceland. So it exactly was like 10,000 people gathered. This was in Orlando a bunch of years ago. And then President Trump was president at the time. And he decided these were his people. And he announced several days before that he would speak at this conference. And they scheduled his talk exactly the same time as our talk. There was me, one of the therapists, one of the veterans that we'd worked with. And then we have a senior retired DEA official who's now acting as a consultant to us, because his son went to Iraq and got PTSD and came back and found cannabis to be helpful to him. And it changed his dad's mind, so he's now becoming Tony Colson. His name, he's become one of our main advisors. So there was a police officer in the Well, we went to our room. It was big from 350 people or something, but because everybody went to see Trump. There was only like 20 people in our room. But there was 20 of the right people. We said, OK, these are people that really want to hear us. And in the front row, was this police officer. And he came to us afterwards. And he said, I'm also a psychotherapist, Sarco Gerion, this is name. And he said he wanted to do our training program to give MDMA to other police officers with PTSD. And so we said, this is fantastic. We would love to train you. This is exactly what we want to do. This is for everybody. And so he's been through our training program. He was featured on the Netflix documentary of How to Change Your Mind by Michael Collins-Bug. And so we brought him to Iceland. So that's how. So we came to Iceland with a police officer and he brought his police chief They're there from Winthrop outside of Boston, luckily. And so that they came as part of the delegation to Sarco did to be at the conference. And so what came from it is that we met with the Minister of Justice and his deputy. And they said that they would be interested in paying for a study to give MDMA to victims of crime, to prisoners in prison and police guards and police officers. And so we're now planning a training of Icelandic therapists to take place the first week of August. And once we are training them, then we'd like to do this study, which would be one of the most important ones to try to reduce recidivism and also to try to work with victims of crime and to see if I think it's very traumatizing to be a prison guard. I mean, that's one of the hardest jobs I can imagine. If they can learn how to sort of work through their own traumas and process all these emotions you think the prison guards could be more humane or the prisoners might be less violent if we deal with their traumas. So what happened in Iceland was One of our goals is the long term goal, is we're calling it a net, a world of net zero trauma by 2070. So, you know, it's almost a 50 years away, but I think this idea of how do we spread the psychedelic healing, how do we spread that all over the world? How do we deal with the, right now there's a hundred million displaced people, refugees or migrants. There's a prediction that if climate change continues by 2050, There may be a billion climate refugees. And a lot of them are from wars and struggles too, because when you fight over limited resources and then there's more. So what we would like to do is think about Iceland as a test case. It's a small country. We have the support of people in the government. There are a bunch of therapists already there. Can we have a country that has net zero trauma? And if we can demonstrate in the small way and ice, then maybe we can imagine. you know okay there's 380,000 people there and there's 7.8 or whatever billion people in the world but but that could be an example and so with a country that's small you can kind of work with their national health insurance and with their education system and it's it's a lot easier so Iceland we hope will become a test case in a way for how do you build a whole country that has less and less producing trauma to the point where, you know, because trauma, it lasts. So there's multi-generational trauma. There's epigenetic mechanisms in the body where trauma gets passed from generations to generation. So Iceland, we're hoping, can be a test case in a way for this. That's brilliant, did you? Is this your idea? Well, I mean, it was a collective. That is amazing. How long do you, how long do you anticipate this taking to create a country? Oh, I mean, 20, 30 years. I mean, I mean, again, you have to Maybe it could be faster, but right now in Iceland, let's say, there's not that many satellite therapists. We have to do the studies. We have to train the therapists. We have to get it embedded in their national health insurance. maybe it could be done in 15 years or something, but the other thing about Iceland is that it's a very spiritual place, or ready. The nature is incredible, and they have northern lights, and they have volcanoes, and they have, you know, the continental divide, in a way we think of where the, you know, in America, where the waters, but they've got the tectonic plates are separating. So Iceland is growing a little bit like an inch a year or something like that. But the natural wonder of Iceland is just incredible. They have hot springs and bad hot baths all over it. But it's just extraordinary. So it's already kind of a mystical. But they have a lot of darkness because it's so elevated. I mean, so high up in the northern hemisphere. And so we are that they have one of the most highest percentages of people on psychiatric medications, really, of any country in the world. Dead doesn't just show up one day, it builds.

Because they do have wealth enough to pay for medicines. And they used to be quite poor, but now they have so much tourism for the natural wonders. So I think that It is a good test case. It's also surrounded by water. It's an island. Greenland, there's only like 60,000 people or something like that. So it is a natural experiment. It could be. And there are more and more people that are moving to Iceland. But most people are from this kind of one culture and know each other a lot. Actually, what we were told by the Minister of Justice is that a lot of the people in prison are actually from outside Iceland. where that come foreign gangs will come to do drugs or other ways of criminal enterprises. and then they give us it, and then they're not integrated into Icelandic society. And so I think it's a real opportunity. Now, earlier, when you read my bio, I just said that you said I did a 30 plus year of follow-up to the Tim Leary's Concord Prison Experiment. So that was actually from 61 to 63. And that was an experiment to see if you could give prisoners still a side of an experience, while they're in prison. to help them have this sort of pro-social, I'm connected with everything, work through their traumas, and then when they come out that then they would be less likely to reoffend and be sent back to jail. And so this was Timothy Leary would then do, he would bring people into the prisons and the researchers would also do psilocybin, with the prisoners. Yeah, he would have some of the researchers that were not, but somewhere we're doing the sales side. And this was considered to be one of the most effective, psychedelic studies that had ever taken place. So so after the backlash and actually So again, 1970, the Control Substance Act, after research was wiped out for several decades all over the world with psychedelics, we would look back, what are some of the most successful experiments? And the conquered prison experiment was considered to be one of those. And so they also did what's called the Good Friday Experiment, Timothy Leary and Walter Panke, and others, this was on Good Friday, 1962 in Boston. And it was also to see if psychedelic could produce a mystical experience. And so they took 20 divinity students from and over noon into church on Good Friday, and they all got a pill half was psilocybin half was placebo. And the minister was an incredible guy whose name was Howard Thurman. And he's African American ministers no longer alive. He was Martin Luther King's mentor. Martin Luther King got a PhD at Boston University. But more importantly than, or not more importantly, but in background, Howard Thurman had spent time with Gandhi. And he had learned about nonviolent resistance. And he was the one that really helped guide Martin Luther King and others into the strategy of nonviolence for the American civil rights movement. And our determined was sympathetic with this idea of the political implications of the mystical experience, meaning that we're all connected, meaning that you can't be so racist if you realize, I mean, if you look at the difference in genetic material between somebody that's black and somebody that's white, there's no difference, that's hardly the trivial. And so I did a follow-up to the good Friday experiment and showed that it basically was confirmed. I attracted these people down roughly 25 years later. But then, and that got attention to media and fellow from the corrections, the Department of Corrections for Massachusetts, contacted me and said, he had all the information of who the prisoners were in the Concord Prison Experiment. Did I want to do a follow-up to that study? And I said, I'd love to it because the names are all lost. Nobody knew who these people were. There was no way to do this until this guy said that they had kept the records of people in the Concrete Prison Experiment. Wow. All right. So then I did this long term file. We spent a whole year of getting permission. And when all that we have to govern her well, it was the time of Massachusetts. And the permissions slip that we got was hilarious because it gave us permission. But somebody had scribbled on it. No, silly, silent. Like, of course, we're just asking people and checking their criminal records, but we're planning to give so to happen. They just wanted to make sure. But then I discovered to my dismay that Larry had fudge the results, and it wasn't successful. And it was weird that it was somebody who was me as an advocate for psychedelics wanting to bring attention to what was the what I thought one of the best studies because because what Tim said himself is oh you have a spiritual experience you know people will tell you about that but how do you know and and you know that's why this long term followed was so important but he said with reducing recidivism that's objective you can tell it's not about their minds do they go back to prison or not that'll tell if it works and he claimed that it worked And so when I looked at the data, it took me a long time, but I started feeling that this data doesn't represent what was reported. And so I discovered that what had happened is that Liri and the other team, Ralph Metzner and others, had realized that the psychedelic experience is not enough. It's enough to give you a good start, but you need support afterwards. So the same way that you need it in grayion after a psychedelic experience. If you're trying to reduce recidivism, you can't just and give people a say to experience, kick them out the prison, don't worry, they're going to do okay. And just as they realize that they started creating these support groups, and then they got kicked out of Harvard. So this was what we all brought to Iceland, is that this experiment was never really done fully because the experimenters themselves realized that they overemphasize the psychedelic experience and under-emphasize the integration in the support afterwards. And then if we were to do something like that to try to reduce recidivism, if you combine the psychedelic experience with the aftercare and have a control group that just gets the aftercare, We may find that the psychedelic experience really helps in an additive way to reduce racism. And so this is why, in a way, we were able to present this research to the people in Iceland and to say, this would be a tremendous experiment to do here. So how does this experiment start in Iceland? The most important part is training the therapists. It's not just giving the drug. So we have to train the therapists. How many therapists are you going to have? Well, we're going to probably train around four a year or so. Something like that. I don't think they'll all work on the study. And there may be openings to sort of compassionate use for MDMA, other things that may happen in Iceland as well. But it would start as a small pilot study. But politically, OK. So I often say that we don't do science. We do political science. because these are suppressed things we're just coming back to the surface. So it's very important for us to say, and this is what we said in Iceland, that we want to work with victims of crime as well as perpetrators of crime. And we also want to work with the prison guards and the police. So the recidivism part will only be with the prisoners, obviously. But we want to have more of a comprehensive, we're bringing this into the carceral system. and we're trying to help everybody affect it in different ways. So there's several parts of training therapists. So, for example, Trevor, Trevor has done eye-begin. You would not be so comfortable going to Trevor if he'd never done eye-begin. To give you eye-begin. Absolutely correct. All right, so we have an initial training which is about 100 hours. And so the big part of it is 60 hours online, it's more background information. What is our treatment method? How do we evaluate therapists? What's the history of MDMA? What do we know about other psychedelics? And then there's about 40 plus hours that's in person. And so that's what we're going to do in Iceland is they're going to do the video part first and then we're going to bring a team there for a week to get together. But then the second part is that we want the therapist who want to is never compulsory, but the therapist that want to volunteer to have their own MDMA experience as a patient themselves. And with therapists, so stuff always comes up. We're all, you know, we all have issues. So you know, the therapists may not have a PTSD or depression diagnosis. It's still valuable for personal growth, for all sorts of issues. So we also then have to get a protocol approved in Iceland. to give MDMA to therapists who volunteer for it. Okay, all right, so that's the second step. First step is the training that's gonna take place. Starting probably in June and July, the online portion, then they do the week in August. Then after that, hopefully we get permission before the end of the year to have a protocol where therapists can receive MDMA. Now we want the therapists who administer MDMA to to new therapists to have worked with PTSD patients. to know our method. And so we may have to send therapists the same way we're sending them to do the training. We will send some therapists there to give MD made other therapists. Okay. All right. And then the third part of our training is they actually work with patients. And it's all videotaped. And we have what are called adherence Raiders. And so, and there's the treatment manual that describes the therapy. There's adherence criteria. How are you know are you doing the treatment the way we say it should be done? to do this treatment manual. And then we have raiders that watch the video tapes and give feedback to the therapists. And so that's the final part of the training. And so once all of that's done, then this experiment with reducing recidivism with victims of crime, then that can start. And actually it can start where the first group is what's called open label, but that means is there's no placebo. Everybody open label means everybody knows what it is. So we train these initial people as they work with prisoners or victims of crime. where everybody knows they get MDMA. And then once they know the method, then we can say, oh, now we can do a controlled study if we're going to do that. So that's the sequence. Okay, fascinating. How long do you think this entire experiment is going to take? Well, the recitivism is one of the hardest things to study because it takes a long time to study it. Yeah. And one of the things I realized about the conquered prison experiment that was scientifically fraudulent, I wouldn't say, I am reluctant to use that word, but the experiment that they did with the prisoners, once they got out of prison, they would do these follow-ups, and the follow-ups were done an average of people out of prison for 10 months. But then their base rates, that they did a study of everybody released from the prison in the years prior to this experiment. And then they published the base rates of that. But in the analysis, they compared people that had been out of prison for two years to people that had been out of prison for ten months. So obviously, the people who have been out of prison for ten months are going to have lower recities than the people who had been out of prison for two years. The longer you're out of jail, the more likely you are, something to happen. So it was completely fraudulent. You know, comparison. But it was done in this obscure British printed prison criminology journal or something. I'm just shocked that all the people that they were against psychedelics never checked this. But when I finally discovered, I'm like, You know, I had to go in the dusty archives at Harvard Library to get this, you know, and probably most closely wouldn't even have this journal. But I was able to, and when I read this, I was like, oh my God. Because not only that, that they have the two month data, but they had a chart of how what the recidivism rate was from the beginning to the 24 months, the two years. And they have the 10 month rate. And when you look at the 10 month rate to the 10 month rate, it's the same. Okay, but I didn't know people just didn't check and then I had to decide shit should I like debunk this great study for psychedelics and I felt I am about science. I've got I can't just pretend to so I did report that and I reported it and A little bit of a gentle way, but I said this experiment is bunk. Let's talk about the mental health crisis here in America. Just yesterday, right down the street in Green Hills, Nashville, there was an active shooter, killed six people, three children, three adults. A lot of people are thinking psychedelics is the answer to this. My question is how would we even begin to implement that? by themselves, we tend to put too much power in the thing. Again, it's the therapy. So let's just say psychedelic assisted therapy. And in psychedelic assisted therapy, to give you a sense of what our method is for treating PTSD. It's 42 hours of therapy, and it's with two therapists, usually a male female, but not always. And now when we negotiate with FDA, one of the two needs to be licensed as a therapist, the second can be an apprentice working to get a license or doesn't have a license. But it's 42 hours of therapy. There's only three times that people get MDMA and it's one month apart and these are for eight hour sessions. So in addition to these three eight hour sessions, which add up to 24 hours, there are 12, 90 minute non-drug psychotherapy sessions as well. So there are three of these non-drug psychotherapy sessions as preparation. So I'm sure when you went down, you had some time with Trevor and others before you did the audience. And imagine you had something on the phone before? Yeah, so the way it worked was we got a coach and a therapist and we could talk to the coach whenever we wanted. We had therapy, I think, two sessions. If I remember correctly before we went down, Then you go down to Trevor's place, and you have three days of preparatory. You know, doing different, just all kinds of different stuff. You kind of group chats, sweat, lodge, all, write your intentions down, talk about your intentions, all of that stuff. Then you do it, you do the eye-be-gain, and then the five of me, and then When you leave, you continue with your integration period. And I went a little longer than I guess recommended, but because I really, I just really wanted to dig in, but I think I did four, I think I did four therapy sessions afterwards. So we have three these 90 minute sessions before the first MDMA, and then three of them after each MDMA for integration. So it's a large amount of therapy punctuated by these MDMA experiences. So how would we bring this to bear at a large scale to really reduce the mental health crisis? We're hoping to train around 25,000 therapists. That's nowhere near enough, in this decade. That's nowhere near enough. There's estimated 13 million PTSD patients in America. And there's even more that people have depression. Yeah. There's loads of people that are addicted to dependent on alcohol or other drugs and opioids. Oh, yeah. I think it's going to take, that's why we're saying net zero trauma by 2070. I think it's really going to take generations to do this. But I think the steps are going to be working with the FDA to get MDMA approved as a medicine for PTSD and then we want to look at it for other things as well. There are groups that are working to make psilocybin into a medicine. and they're suggesting that maybe 2025 or so, you know, they might be able to 2025, 2025. I am trying to try to do I begin research and others are as well to try to bring that forward. There's researchers now working on just five Emmy-ODMT. So what we had now in America, there's roughly 1,500 ketamine clinics. So ketamine has been developed as ketamine, an isomer of ketamine, but it's a classic pharma play in a sense that it was developed without therapy. Pharma companies don't know psychotherapy. And ketamine and all these drugs, as we talked about earlier, they have a pharmacological effect, a psychological effect, and you can do some good without sometimes without taking it with psychotherapy. But you can also do harm. And so the way ketamine has been approved, it's without psychotherapy. And a lot of these clinics that are really smart and wise combine it with therapy. You get better results, you don't need as much ketamine, it lasts longer. So what we're going to have to set up, I think, is thousands and thousands and thousands of psychedelic treatment centers. And the goal is to not have, here's a ketamine center, here's an MDMA center, here's an eye-began center, here's this. It's, we want to train psychedelic therapists, and they want to be cross-trained into all the different drugs. And then when a person comes to this treatment center, now we are also doing a lot of work to try to get this covered by insurance and we think we've got good responses so far from the insurance companies because the cost of untreated PTSD is really high. But then people will come to this treatment center and they will then have a customized program developed for them by these trained therapists. And so I think over the next, by 2032, we've had some estimates that we will hopefully treat about 1.4 million people. That's a lot of people. Yeah, that's a lot of people. But that's nothing compared to 13 million people at our PTSD. And the number is growing. Right? So the other part to answer your question about how do we really change the mental health crisis? There's two main things I'd say. The one is that we need to legalize. and regulate these drugs. And we need to make it so that people could try it on their own. And maybe you had a small drama, you know, but if you don't do something it becomes PTSD, but if you treat it, or maybe people just so, so within this post-provision world, what we need is pure drugs available to people, so they're not getting contaminated, drugs dying from fentanyl or something. We need honest drug education, instead of the dare program that scares, we need honest drug education. We need to train people in peer support. So we have what we call the Zendo Project, which is a group where we do psychedelic harm reduction at burning man and other events. So places where people go to do psychedelics and we would say non-medical settings. a lot of times they're just looking for fun and something difficult comes up and then they're not prepared to deal with that or they're not even looking for fun but still something difficult comes up and then they don't know what to do and often they would get tranquilized or they could become problem for authorities that could get arrested. So what we want to show is that what we're proposing in a therapeutic setting makes sense in sort of non-medical settings. So we have hundreds of volunteers that we organize every year at Burning Man. And last year we had about 500 and over 500 people came for help. really. Yeah, often from either rather in the midst of a really difficult psychedelic experience, or they had one the day before, and now they're trying to integrate it. And so we did widespread understanding about peer support. So we train people in peer support, psychedelic harm reductions, so people can help each other. So with all of those things, with a post-prodition world, with all of that, then I think we can over time work both with people with a diagnosis that then gets covered by insurance, and then people can do this on their own in a wiser way than just with no guidance. The other answer to your response to your question is that we need to move to treat people closer to the trauma. So what that means is right now, the FDA has forbidden us from working with people that are younger than 18, that have PTSD. But they've said that if you make MDMA into a medicine for people that are, you know, if they give us permission to make MDMA prescription medicine for adults, designed as 18 or over, that we must do a study with adolescents. And if that works, we have to work with 7 to 11 year olds. So I think we need to move sooner to treating people for the trauma. Now, the other part of this relates to the veterans and the VA and the Department of Defense. So we're now in about seven or eight VA's. It took forever. It took the intervention of Richard Rockefeller, who was David Rockefeller's son, who he was chair of the Board of Advisors of Doctors Without Borders. and he came to help us, and I worked with him very closely to lead Died, tragically in a plain crash, but it was his cousin, Senator J. Rockefeller, that was from West Virginia, that was on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. And together, they were able to influence the VA. This is now in 2014 to let us pay for studies with VA therapists. But they wouldn't let us do it inside the VA, and they would not refer vets to us. But we were able to start that way. We had also started in the San Diego Naval Medical Center. where there was Rob McLeate was the chief psychiatrist there and they have a two-week program for Navy SEALs and Marines and others with PTSD and inpatient program and he was interested in giving some of them M.D. May and see if they did better than the others. So this is where I learned about military hierarchy and bureaucracy. So I didn't know this. Now I see. So Robert Clay was great and he said, I want to do this study, but I can't do it unless I get the permission of the admiral who runs the facility. So the admiral says, OK, it's OK with me, but now you've got to get permission from all the way up from the Secretary of the Navy. just so happened that Richard Rockefeller knew the Secretary of the Navy. This was Ray Babis. And then in this, so he talked to him and we got a meeting at the Pentagon. So here I am a draft resistor and you may remember that the hippies, the hippies, the hippies, but the hippies surrounded the Pentagon as one of their protests against the Vietnam War. They said they were going to levitate the Pentagon. they did not succeed. But here I am walking into the Pentagon all these years later to talk to them about psychedelics. And we met with the assistant, Juan Garcia was the assistant secretary of the Navy. And it turned out that he was a friend of mine from the Kennedy School when I got my masters. And we'd been friends that day. He knew I was interested in NMDMA, but we hadn't stayed in touch. Our careers went in different places completely. But here it is now. He's the assistant secretary of the Navy. And we met with him in the Navy search. In general, we caught up. He knew my girlfriend at the time. It was not my wife. So they said yes, they'd love to do the study, but they're not high enough in the hierarchy. We have to go to the assistant secretary or defense for health affairs. And we have to have that meeting. And meanwhile, we got these letters from J. Rockefeller, Senator Rockefeller to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, and then J. intervened with the Secretary of the V.A. You know, and it all came together with this meeting, and they said, we do not want you to work with activities soldiers. And their rationale was terrible. The rationale was, the need is so great that if we permit you to do work with active duty soldiers, we're worried that the word would get out that this is okay and a lot of people will self-medicate. You've got to be kidding me. That's what they said, and I said, worried it was going to be successful. There was worried it would be successful or just the experiment would send the word and people would self-medicate and they're trying to make it so people only do the drugs that they give you rather than. And so they said, we want you to start with the veterans. And so I guess the bigger story here is that we need to move closer to the trauma. And when you look at a lot of the people that are in the prisons, a lot of them had traumatic childhood. I imagine that something may have happened with the shooter who knows, you know, in childland or So I think to achieve this goal kind of of a mentally mass mental health. It's going to take generations. But it starts by getting some of these drugs approved, getting these clinics set up, training more therapists, getting insurance coverage, and over time, globalizing. And I'd say one of the biggest challenges we face now is that we now are at this incredible moment, this incredible moment that after April 8th coming right up is the 37th anniversary of maps. Congratulations. Yeah, and so I started in 1986, 37 years later, we're on the verge. We think we have two successful phase three studies. We hope by June of 2024, we may actually, we project hopefully getting FDA approval. And we've raised about $145 million in grants and donations to this point, and a lot of donated labor, a lot of donated labor, but the rise of the for-profit psychedelic companies a few years ago made it more difficult for us to achieve donors to reach donations because a lot of people thought they could just invest. So we do have roughly $63 million from investors, but it's 43 million in what's called a royalty share. Meaning that they don't own equity, but they get a share of the royalties. We have a $20 million more or less convertible note loan for two years. But right now we have this remarkable situation where the non-profit is the 100% owner of the for-profit public benefit pharmaceutical company. And so we're at this crossroads. And the next couple of months is going to be the turning point we needed to raise. We're looking now to raise around $75 million to get us to FDA approval. And then after FDA approval, there's going to be another bunch of money we need to raise to get to what's called sustainability. sales and profits from the sale of MDMA covers the costs and then brings in more money for more research and things like that. If we can get the FDA approval, we're going to have a lot of other ways to raise money, more royalty shares or selling off rights to certain countries. We were approached by a company from South Korea. Actually, that's talking to us about bringing MD made a South Korea and maybe they'd pay us a certain amount of money or things like so what we're trying to do is in the next couple months figure out can we find donors or willing to donate so that public benefit remains the number one goal or do we find money from investors that then means that we become most likely a publicly traded company. And so my hope is that we do this through philanthropy. You know, I don't own anything. Those of us that may have none of us who owns anything because it's a nonprofit. And the nonprofit is what owns the shares of the public benefit court. But if we have to sell them to the public, then I think things will change in terms of priorities when you have to respond to invest. Already, we need to take into account the investors that have given us money. We need to give them a good return. We need to do the best to get royalties. But it's not maximized royalties. And there are mission-related. All the people that have invested so far are mission-related people. So the hope is that we will find donors and that then we can have this rare situation of a psychedelic pharmaceutical company, 100% owned by a non-profit. That's also willing to legalize and make it available outside of us. So what we might charge substantial amount of money for the drug, we want people to be able to buy it for $10 or $20, too. And we think people will most likely, Those people that are really severely traumatized, or even not that, but modernist is fear trauma, will go to the train therapists. So, I think legalization is good for the business model. A lot of people think legalization is bad for the business model. And a lot of for profit-farmac companies, or a psychedelic-farmac companies, are not speaking out about the need to move to a post-provision world. But I actually think that that's what we need for mass mental health. That's what we need for ethics. And that's what we need to really fully move forward with public benefit in mind. So I think that the choices are going to be coming to us in the next three years months. That's one of the reasons why I'm so glad the timeliness of this podcast with you. And then we're having the world's largest psychedelic conference ever. And it's going to be June 19th to 23rd in Denver. Really, yeah. It's called Second All Excients, 2023. We've had one of these in 2010, Second All Excients got where we bring the whole field together. The whole field was pretty small back in 2010. Then we had one in San Jose, then we had one in 2013 and one in 2017 in Oakland. And the 2017 one was the world's largest Second All Conference. We had about 3,000 people there. We already have 4,500 people coming to this one and it's I'll a little bit less than three months away. Wow. So psychedelic science.org. It's going to be incredible. We have over 300 speakers. People come from all over the world. We have the Denver Convention Center. We have enormous number of exhibitors from all these companies. And so I think that will be either we have raised what we need by them or that will be the announcement of here's what we need to do one way or another to to raise three sources. And I'd say that the biggest loss of public benefit would be if we don't raise the money and never make MDMA into a medicine. So if we have to go with investors that want us to become a publicly traded company, we will do that. My preference, though, would be to do this through philanthropy. So for anybody that wants to donate, where do they go? Well, maps.org. Maps.org. Yeah. And if you want to donate a substantial amount, it's probably better for you to ask maps at maps.org and just ask for a meeting. Okay, or something like that, or just call the map's office, but I think that what we're hoping is that when we talk about what we want to accomplish, the world is in danger right now. I mean, the mental health crisis is getting worse, the pandemic made it way worse. It seems like it's getting worse and if it's true that there could be a billion climate refugees by 2050, the stresses on everybody, it's going to keep getting worse. So I really think that If we can keep focus on not maximizing money, we've already built a structure. The public benefit corp is a modification of capitalism. So a normal company, and almost all the companies that we know are normal for profit companies, their mission is to maximize profits and if you're a minority shareholder in a company and you think that the management is not maximizing profits you can get the other shareholders and you throw them out and you replace people who will maximize profits and that's like a That's one of the problems of capitalism, is that all these externalities, these companies don't think about. So the oil companies are doing massive profits, but they're not having to pay for climate change. But they're maximizing profits. So the public benefit corporation was created. I'm not sure exactly when, but maybe 20 years ago or something like that. It's a modification of capitalism where it is a for-profit company, but you maximize public benefit, not profit. So minority shareholders cannot sue the management if you're not maximizing profits. So let's say we want to go to Rwanda, or we want to go to South Africa, or Ukraine. You know, are all the Ukrainian refugees. We want to treat massive amounts of trauma, where there's virtually no money. If we're profit maximizing, we wouldn't do anything. But if we're about net zero trauma by 2070, that means we have to have a global focus. And we go where the trauma is, not where the money is. And so if people do want to donate, we would be delighted. There's also the nonprofit maps, which doesn't, you know, nearly as much money as the benefit core. And we do public education. We do harm reduction. We do all the fundraising for the benefit core. We do policy and advocacy. We do a lot of things through the nonprofit. So people can just donate to the nonprofit. for our own purposes, okay, you know, which in small amounts. So I also want to say that, you know, we're talking about such big numbers. And so people might think, oh, if I donate $50, that means nothing, and that's not at all true. You know, it absolutely means something. Yeah. Um, where do you see the most pushback coming from legalizing that stuff? Well, I think that in a time right now, we're over 100,000 people died last year from opiate overdoses. There is more of a bipartisan view that the drug war itself is not a good idea. That's why I would actually like to see a study done, perhaps by the CIA, about the national security implications of legalizing drugs. I think that if that study were to be done and we look at all the bad actors that are making all sorts of money from drug dealing, and of course we like some people who make money off of drugs too. But added all up my guess is that we would decide that it's an advantage to legalize drugs from a national security perspective. So I don't think the pushback is going to come from drug lawyers. in that way. The pushback that came in the initial backlash was cultural. It was against the counterculture. Nixon was saying that, well, actually, John Ehrlichman was Nixon's domestic policy advisor. And I think it was in 79. He spoke to a reporter and he said that the two main enemies of the Nixon White House were blacks and hippies. And he said, if we can criminalize the drugs that they use, we can bust up their meetings, we can arrest their leaders. Because they can't stop the protests, but if we criminalize the drugs, and then Alchemist said, did we know we were exaggerating the risk of drugs? Of course we did. But it was a political tool. So I think that we have done so much work and also I would say the reason that we have bipartisan support is like yourself. A lot of veterans who have had struggles with PTSD and America thinks of veterans in a highway and high regard and we should that I don't think it's going to come back. The backlash is going to come that way. All right, then the next backlash came late in the 70s, early the 80s when it looked like marijuana might get legalized. The backlash then came from parents. And it was parents worried about their kids. So this was partnership for a drug free America. And this was families against drugs. And all these different kind of families in action, I think it was different. So I think that that's kind of past two. And so I think where the backlash would come from, if it will come from, it's not quite clear where it will come from, but I would say that the thing that I'm worried about is fundamentalists. So what we're talking about is the spiritual experiences, these kind of unit of mystical experiences, and they're accessible to everybody. And when you have those experiences, sometimes they're mediated through certain religious symbols or people, but sometimes not. So I think there's a kind of a universal spirituality. And I think that a lot of the fundamentalists from, I mean, I look what's happening in Israel right now. The fundamentalist orthodox Jews, the ultra-orthodox are destroying the country in many different ways. They're the most racist, the most homophobic, the most hateful for Palestinians. Um, you know, and we see that. We, we've got the, so, so I think, fun, I'm just saying fun amounts of any kind. Yeah. Are willing to look at what's happening with the Taliban and Afghanistan. So, and, and they, their narrative is that there's one right way we know it and everybody else is an infidel and we will kill you. Yeah. You know, so I think they're so in need of this deeper spirituality, though. So both that's where I think a big opportunity as well. So actually this Saturday, I'm speaking at Harvard Divinity School. They're having a psychedelic revival in a way. And there's incredible information that's coming out about what's called the elucinian mysteries. So this is the world's longest running mystery ceremonies. It went from 1600 BC to around 480, and it was wiped out by the Catholic Church. because they could put themselves in a hierarchy between you and God. But the Ellisonian mysteries was involving a potion that people drank, called kick-yon, and now we understand it was a psychedelic potion similar to LSD. And this is the foundation of democracy. It was the Greeks. We think our culture comes from the Greeks, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, everybody that we think of as the epitome of the Greek culture and the flowering of the creation of democracy had a psychedelic experience as part of their lives. And it was considered so important This is kind of funny to say, but they would let women and slaves do it too. Wow. It wasn't just limited to men. Women and slaves could do this. And you were under pain of death to say what actually happened. You should not share that. And so we don't know exactly what happened. But I think that this sense that the psychedelic experience can be interpreted in many different contexts. So I'd like to say that it's like languages. We have, we're not going to say that English is a better language than Russian, or is a better language than German. They come from our common human need to communicate. And according to cultural context, we come up with different sounds that we make that we call our language. I think religion can be seen like that, that there's a common spirituality, and we come up in different cultural contexts. I grew up in a Jewish context. I don't think that only Jews go to heaven or that, you know, I don't, Jews are the chosen people, according to the Bible. But the way I think about it is everybody's the chosen people. Yes, Jews are the chosen people, but so are you, so is everybody. It's kind of an egotistical kind of, but it's a way to make us feel distinct and better. So I think that the fundamentalists of different religions are so holding on to literal interpretations of things that I think deep down their super insecure I mean it's interesting you say that because I've done I've done quite a few episodes on psychedelics not by now and and as much as I shouldn't I do go into the comments and it's it's always it's always the how do I say this? It's always the very religious people that against it. Everybody's for this, it seems like, but the people that are that can't see outside of their religion and have been indoctrinated in their religion. I hate to use that term. But those are the ones that they can't see the benefit. They think, oh, well, just you need Jesus. You need God. You need to pray. Yeah, you know what? I do need those things. If that is what you believe and don't you don't you think God, or Jesus, or Allah, or whoever you're praying to, don't you think they would want us to be better? Yeah. Don't you think they would want the pain and the suffering to go away? Yeah, brother David, who I talked about. talked about how Jesus is the Son of God. But the way he hears that is so is everybody. You know, it's not untrue that we are all the children of God. But what's untrue is that one group has a monopoly on spirituality. Now, most people in the world would not agree with him saying right now or And so I think there's this sense about how do we reach out to fundamentalists and say, if you let go of the literalism, there will be a richness that you can experience that doesn't make you turn away from what you believe in. You know, yes, we can see some of the miracle stories may be reinterpreted. Some of my wife actually, this is a good example. My wife worked for the World Council of Churches. She actually, one of her first jobs out of college was she was a lobbyist in Washington, but she was a lobbyist for the Quakers. And she said that they We're always not violent and they define success as if somebody says we're all in favor of this expansion of the military budget. Everybody agrees with that. Then they would say, well, we don't agree. That was their success, you know, that at least somebody could hear there was its ascending voice. Then she worked for the World Council of Churches in Geneva and traveled all over the world during Third World Women Development. And this is a more progressive group than the Vatican in some ways. And so they reinterpreted the miracle of the loaves and the fissures. So we have Jesus giving this incredible sermon on the Mount. And then there's all these people that he wants to feed and there's not enough food. And so all of a sudden, this few lows in the fishes, the multiplication, so now it's a miracle and it feeds everybody. So their interpretation of it was that these miracle stories are designed in a way by power structures. and their stuff that we can't do. I can't make a miracle in multiplying those ambitions and stuff. But what they interpreted is that what happened was Jesus gave a beautiful talk about how we're all in this together and how we should share. And so the real miracle is people overcame their selfishness and shared and then there was enough for everybody. So I think we can reinterpret a lot of these miracle stories. Because when you say it's a miracle of how we created the loaves and the fishes, I don't have to do that. I can't do that. But if you say I should be less selfish, Jesus talked to people about being less selfish, that means I have to do something. And so you could see how people might move away from that because then, so I do think, I'm curious, where do you think the backlash would come from if it does come? I think the backlash, excuse me, I think the backlash will come from Big Farmer. I don't think that at all. Really? I don't think that at all. And I guess I'll say that, what can they do? Nothing. So the way the FDA, I don't perceive any pressure right now from Big Farmer on the FDA to slow us down. Really? Not at all. And in fact, Merck invented MDMA in 1912. They tested it in animals in 1927, and they found nothing. They didn't understand what to look for. They tried it again in 1959 in animals again found nothing, but Merck is the one that developed really empty. Now it's in the public domain. So a few years ago, some of our people in the Benefit Corps were trying to think, how do we do work in Europe? And so they knew someone who was a senior person at Merck, who was an expert in Europe and doing research in the regulatory systems in Europe. And she joined one of our calls for free to help us. And this is their own drug. So another thing to say is that a lot of the drugs that Big Pharma has done for psychiatry are generic now. So I don't think Big Pharma is going to come after us at all. I just don't see it. And so I think this other part of you know, the political backlash. I don't see that either. And in fact, just as an example of that, I'll say that, you know, with Marcus, we were just in Dallas a few days ago, and Governor Rick Perry was there. And he was governor of Texas for 15 years. He was in Trump's cabinet as Secretary of Energy. And he's heard all these stories from Navy SEALs that have gone down and got eye-be-gain. He talked about Marcus Latrell, actually. So this is the story. He just told that Marcus Latrell lived at the governor's office with him. And he heard his story. And he helped him now. He's a member of Congress. But he heard Marcus talk about doing eye-be-gain. Now, Governor Perry is pro psychedelics. He's helping in many ways. I had an incredible meeting with Ted Nugent and his son, Raccoon. And this was just a couple weeks ago. Well, two months ago, something like that. And I had never thought that there would be any kind of common ground that I might have with Ted Nugent. But there is, and it's Rocco his son is interested in becoming a psychedelic therapist. Get out of here. Really? Yes. And Rocco set it up between his father and I. Wow. And what Ted said is actually that he could be a particularly good advocate because he's so anti-drug. Wow. And he's friends, Ted Nigen is friends with Governor Perry. So all of this is to say that I think that the backlash is not going to come from any kind of a political thing. I really don't see it coming from big pharma. So here's just another way why I don't think it from big pharma. The way the FDA is organized, it's to protect A pharma company is from having influence because if pharma companies could influence the FDA, then they'd all be trying to do that against all their other competitors. And so, for example, if I'm trying to make a drug XYZ into a medicine and I do a bunch of studies and it turns out that this drug has terrible safety consequences and the FDA says we're stopping this, you cannot make this drug into a medicine. Some other company comes and says, I want to make XYZ into a medicine. The FDA is not allowed to tell them that they've already rejected the drug to somebody else. So when people say, what is the FDA think about what you're doing? The FDA doesn't make announcements about it. I can announce, oh, we've got FDA approval. We've done this. We've done that. I mean, for this project or that, they will announce, of course, if they approve things for medicines. But the FDA is designed pretty to insulate themselves, and it's for the benefit of all the pharma companies as well. So I think really it's up to us. I think if we can do this in a careful responsibility. So I think one of the biggest problems is and this I saw happening during the 60s is the government exaggerated the risks terribly and denied the benefits and then shut down research for decades. But if we exaggerate the benefits and deny the risks then we will be the cause of problems. So I think so that's why I try to always say it's psychedelic therapy. And it's about integration. It's not just about doing the drug and it doesn't work for everybody. And we have to figure out who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who does it, who conservative in certain ways and really support the veterans. I think you're right. I think it's, it's, I think you're absolutely right. It's people like, like, veterans, like my story, I've put it out there several times, you know, how it benefited me and it, it is starting to change. conservative minds, you know about it because they are seeing the benefits, my dad saw the benefits, my wife saw the benefits, my father-in-law saw the benefits. Everybody around me has seen the benefits. I think that the reason, you know a lot more about this than I do, obviously. But for me, I think the reason the big farmer will get involved is because look at all the drugs that treat depression. Look at all the drugs that treat pain. You know, all the thing PTSD, all these things, they're all addictive. Benzos, you know, addictive. painkillers, addictive, sleep aids, addictive, and because psychedelics and psychedel therapy is so effective, it's not going to be the on going thing year, you know, yeah, it's all every time you're year, year, year, year, year, year. And it's one couple times, maybe a couple times a year and it's done, you know, it's works. You don't have to take it every time. I think that's very true and I think it will result in hopefully, we see a lot of people that have, well, in our studies, people have to get off of their psychiatric medications because they interfere with the effect of MDMA. And many people do not go back on them. So, you know, and we are trying to do a study, we will try to do a study one day where it seems like the SSRI is bluntly effective MDMA. But we need to do a dose response safety study because there's some evidence to suggest that if you double the dose of MDMA on people on SSRI, they can have a full MDMA experience. And so if that's true, the concern has been serotonin syndrome, whether it be overheating, whether it be problems from that. But if there aren't, if we can demonstrate that there are not problems from that, then It opens up to a lot of people who are nervous about getting off their psychiatric meds to do psychedelics. If they could stay on them, and then they get psychedelotherapy that reduces their traumas, their symptoms, then it'll be easier to get off these other drugs. But I do think that big pharma makes most of these drugs that you mentioned have been around for decades and decades, and they are off-patent. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. It does. Yeah, I mean, we just have to do our very best. So I think what we need to do is storytelling. So what is it that really will prevent a backlash from anybody? It's people telling their stories of how these drugs were helpful, or how they were challenging. Just honest information, I think, but people Even, you know, fundamentalists have kids with depression. I was going to say that too. I mean, the opiate, fentanyl crisis is not getting any smaller. And I think just about everybody knows somebody that is, that is, that is, that is, fall in victim to the, to the opiate crisis. You know, and it's going to be, We had in Belmont where I live right outside. It's the right next to Cambridge. You know, where Harvard is right next to Boston. We've had kids in the high school die from overdoses. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's going to be your right story telling like that, uh, if you see in that documentary, Dost. Yeah. You win that documentary. Yeah. I actually haven't seen it, but I'm speaking, uh, that it, Dost is going to be shown in, uh, but in Arlington, uh, May 10th and 11th, I think it isn't. I'm going to speak there. Okay. Yeah. It's going to, I mean, there was a woman in there that, uh, got overcame opioid addiction and and traverse the you know the main guy in there but yeah and it worked and as far as I know she's still funny well the story that I talked about in my TED Talk Tony Macy was one of the veterans this is a beautiful story so yeah people want to check out my TED Talk but what Tony said He's a rare story. It's an incredible story. He had terrible PTSD from Iraq, all that. He disabled basically a lot from PTSD. So during his first MDMA experience, he had this realization. The MDMA centered him, made him feel more peaceful, open as hard, and he realized that there was something good about his PTSD. that it was the way that he showed that he honored the memory of his friends who had died. As long as he was suffering from PTSD, he was keeping alive in his mind the memories of his friends who were no longer alive. And then he kind of was able to think about the friends of his that were no longer alive, looking at him. And they were like, we don't want you to squander your life. morning about us, we cannot live. We would like you to live. Maybe we can live through you.\" And he said, there's another way for me to honor my friend's memory by living. And in that moment, he cured himself with PTSD. And then he said, I'm taking opiates, but I don't think I'm really taking them for pain. I think I can do without him. And he said, I'm going to stop the opiates. And then he said, I don't even think I need the empty amount anymore. This is it. I'm done. I'm fixed. And we said, you can drop out anytime you want, but would you be willing to do the two month and ten month and the one year follow-ups at least, which he agreed to do? And neither of those showed that he had PTSD anymore. And this is now about eight years ago. And we're still in touch. And he went to Cambodia and to do service to other people that were struggling. One of the best ways to get out of depression is to help other people. And so he did that for a while. And so it was just a sense that, yeah, I don't really need these opiates anymore. And I don't even need the same DMA anymore. Which is, you know, great. It's incredible. Yeah. Well, Rick, we are out of time and you have a flight to catch, but I just want to say it is an honor to have you here. I love talking to you. I could have gone on for another four hours.

I just thought we were hanging out. No, no. No, no. Well, you told me Friday. No, it's tomorrow. Don't come on Friday. You want to have like, why not? I don't know. I probably have plans. I have a kickback that's ever shined in, dude. Probably doing something. Let's get Litty. Let's all go see what we're doing. I can't join. Say, let's get laid. Litty. Okay, let's get Litty then. Today is the biggest nitric in our last year, so toss them back, my friend. Let's see here, fancy chef. I was kind of surprised by A lot of friction over the fancy chef calling a lot of disgruntled comments. I can't believe it. I thought I would like team fancy chef all the way. You know, I enjoyed the segment. I enjoyed talking to him. I think his content is very funny. Apparently a lot of people. They found him. I was kind of brainulated from my computer and just shot up the max. But yeah, like you said, a lot of disagreement. In fact, Ali, who usually is down, very down with all of the wacky characters on our show, pretty much immediately. She's like, I can't believe it. He like to stand. So here's what I think's the problem. First of all, there were so many comments who are like, please don't pay him 50,000. Like guys, of course, I'm not going to pay him 50,000. I thought that was all. Like, hello, that's 10 BVOs. I'm not sure I would even pay him a single BVO. Yeah. I'm thinking like maybe... I'm part of the negotiation process, you know? I'm thinking like maybe hotel, coach flight, three-star hotel, and maybe like $500. Yeah, people and shot things are saying, I didn't like it because you were going to pay him 50. No, I would never want to pay him 50. No, you think I'm insane. It's not worth not. I spent listen. Listen, I spent. Money in lots of dumb ways in the history of this show. That is true, but never have I even approached something of that dumb. 50,000. The scorpion chair was close. I was 12,000 and we used it for like two years, but that was awesome. Oh, it wasn't even close to 12,000. It was a six. Oh, there you go. I mean, that's less than a bevo. Yeah, it's true. It's true. 50,000. Hell no. Yeah, I guess I have just a different memory. Yeah, no, the Scorpion chair was a good buy 50 the Gatsby was a good buy these were all well used Yeah, the Star Trek chair was a miss that was a fucking yeah So I wonder, do people's opinions change about fancy if they know that I'm not gonna pay him 50K? And also I think a lot of people thought he was arrogant, but that's just his swag. You guys all understand. Yeah. He's trying to, he's trying to, he's trying to upsell me, you know what I mean? Which I appreciate. Failsman. Here, let's see, he's already claimed he's coming on the show. We do need to figure out what's going on, because he says that he's coming very soon and he's calling me and we need He says he might just show up. Yeah, I think you need to figure out what he's exactly. Yeah, exactly. Let's go ahead and give him the fancy ships at the Fred door. Give him Jimmy's number. It's all that's our bookroom. Oh, that's not sick. Come on. He doesn't deserve that. Yeah, you you have to kind of decide what your counter offer is. I guess I think. Okay. Well, let me hear what he had to say. Okay. I saturated this. Especially. a special ingredient, a saturated fruit. I'm going on an H3 podcast in LA, December's third. I'm going to the tune in and watch. tune in and watch the show. December 3rd is on which we don't we don't have episodes on Tuesday just yeah just to be clear and transparent about everything that date was as far as I know never discussed right well okay now that's we we did discuss he was like do you want me to come like tomorrow we were like no Like, not yet. And he was, and I was like, the soonest that we could potentially do, because he was like, I want to do it before Christmas. And I was like, OK, so you don't want to do it after Christmas. The soonest we could do would be Wednesday the fourth. And then so that would mean that because he said he needs a few days, that would mean that he would arrive. Who would you be doing prep? Right. He said he needed to come several days. But he does a grocery shop. We'll kind of prep what he even'd be doing. No, no, no, no, no, no. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. He won't be. I mean, it wouldn't be pretty awesome to get someone like, and the grocery store filming him. And he won't touch anything, you have to grab everything. He just points. Alright, well, let me hear about it. He's very tender. I saturated this fruit, especially. It's special ingredients. I saturated it through. I'm going on a three-part cast. Very good. That's my boy, fancy. Yeah, when did he said he got us? Yeah, he said he already got us 500,000 views with that call in. That's true. That's a good point. I mean, we did do have that many views at least for the entire episode. Yeah, of which he was one component. No, we never get any views when we go. Okay, I'm going to ask true. No, he did in a few of the texts that he sent in the voicemail. He's billing, did you see? We got 500,000 views for the phone call. So I'm worried that he thinks we used him. Right. Okay. So as far as like realistic offers, now first of all, let's do a pull here. Everybody says they don't like fancy chef. If I could get them for under a thousand, are we liking fancy chef? More? That's a 500% discount. Yeah. Yeah. Five thousand percent discount. Yeah. It's a big discount. So I would counter his offer in a few of. Right. I couldn't go. Yeah, he doesn't like to go negotiate on air, which is sucks because I would love that. Yeah, we don't have to do the live negotiation. But we can figure out our position here. So okay, should we get fancy chef on for less than 1,000 yes get him or no do not get him. Yeah, it's here in barks and he's such a rascal. You are such a rascal. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. It's turning. Oh. Yeah. It's turning. There you go. That's what I'm talking about. It's like, wow. It's a fun thing. Oh, wow. It's a fun thing, you know. 53, 54% say, yes, get him. So let's try this then. Oh, live. Let's reach out. Let's offer him $1,000. Economy. Economy plus. So extra space. Extra space. Extra space. Extra space for the chef. For the chef. and like max, let's say $300 per night hotel. That's good. What about all of his demands for all the things that we buy for him? You wanted a custom apron from like a, from like, no. He wanted two separate chef jackets because he doesn't know what the weather is going to be, so we want short sleep outside. Hey, he wants short sleep, long sleep. He wants both options, and he wants both of them to say fancy chef, and he wants it to, he wants it to have the age 3 emblem. He needs the one with the pockets, and he said that he gave me the name of the lady there because they know him. I think that's that's possible honestly. I mean, how hard is that that's probably one easier request he's made. Oh, I would do it easy. But yeah, we could get him. We'll get him one fancy chef. Oh, he's not gonna like that. He's not gonna like everything. You're going to have to drive a hard bargain with them. Now, I'm getting a lot of feedback here on the poll. So I'm actually going to take that one down and reword it slightly. Wow, a bad poll. Well, a lot of people were saying there's a bad poll. A lot of people were saying that they voted wrong. I thought it was pretty clear, but I think part of the problem is we need more of a gradient in opinions on this rather than a binary, yes or no. So, let's say, should we have the fancy chef? The pictures are always hot. I feel like there would the weather is not really, it doesn't affect the chef too much. Especially outside, because we have to get him a stove. You can't cook that inside. You only cook something. No, we can't bring a stove, a little bit gas stove up, if we rent one. We can just give him like a gas burner. No, he said no. He said no hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot plates. No hot I think you said it on there. No, I did not. I'll say this. It wasn't 50, but it was a lot more than I would want to pay. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I wouldn't have done that either. It was let's say this. It was somewhere between a couple BVos and two BVos. Yeah. I mean, that's where we were putting it, yeah. This point we get it right. Jesus. I think again, I feel like there's gonna be a more we're gonna get more granular information from the least Excited group is the ones that are enthusiastically wanting him up the one that I voted for by the way I feel like a proper poll would be, do you want to watch the segment with Fancy Chef or do you want to talk about it? I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. I'm hoping not. So we definitely want me to put forth a $1,000 offer. I think just to let's see where that gets us. Okay, and, okay, yeah, I'll say that first and nothing about the house. Let's take a look at the front end. Call me plus $300 per night. I'm not going to be so specific because I don't want to disappoint him all at once. Dude, those are expensive. We aren't twins. So not presidential expensive. About business, we're expensive too. The range of dollars per night at a four-star hotel gets you nice, kinks, that bad. Yeah. You know, a nice room, clean room, no fucking X caliber bullshit. You know, the X caliber so ugly, maybe actually feel like I was in a midi. Well, that's what I said at the time is part of the ambio. Yeah. I was so grateful to be back in the area this time. Nice. It's much nicer. Yeah. Oh, let's say about the Arya, their food options. They're supposed to be like this beautiful five star elegant hotel, and their food options are dog shit, bro. Yeah. They have some, okay, like quick stuff, but I haven't tried any restaurants there. Oh my god, I got invited to another poker game, you guys. And it's in LA. What? And I'm gonna do it in the evening. It's um, this casino at I'm pretty sure this is happening. It's called Hustler Casino, it's in LA. I don't know how they operate. I know it is legal, but I don't understand how it works. But they have cash games that they live stream. and they give everybody $10,000 to start with and you like keep the money and play with it. And the people there know how to play poker, so it should be fun. And I believe it's on December or the evening of December. Let me check that. So we're going to stream that. I don't believe we'll, no, we're not going to stream it. It's their thing. Yeah, no. I'm just showing up. I'm just having fun. That's on the sixth. I have a feeling I'm going to clean up on that one. You think so? I do. I sit down with 10k. I'm going to, because I'm playing against people that know how to play poker that obviously puts me at extreme advantage as opposed to playing against amateur. Did we say that's about the last game though? No. Oh, last few days ago, a lot of them did not have played the last game. I think you did. I got them. I think so too. I got an important update. This is a live feed from our ring right now outside the office. Oh, right. How are we? Well, hold on. How are we not? Let how are we in? Well, how can we let him in without also running in Jimmy and fancy chef? We gotta send Jeremiah out there to a strong arm. Okay. How are you? How are you? You're welcome, man. You don't have to... You have a micro dick! Yeah, that's fine. I'll still let you in. I don't know how deep that is, you. I don't want to see your micro jig. You can let it snow ahead in time. You're welcome anytime, Howie. Why are you asking a Jewish person about uncertain-sized penis? Right. I miss Howie. We got to catch up with Howie. Let's catch up with Howie. What's Howie? What's Howie a bit up to? Let me see. Howie does. He's always up to something fun, too. I seem him do the like-tick talks with what's his name? I forgot his name. He's been, he made a new film show. I know what you're talking about. I just don't remember who it was. It was something related to our show. I feel like something that we talked about. Oh, Dax Flames. Thank you. Thanks, right? I am so bad with names. And I get so discouraged when I don't come up with a name. No, I'm like whatever. But yeah, he did a bunch of Instagram reels with Dax Flames. And they're so fucking bad. I like that. Dax is on it. I love that. I thought that that's, Charlie Puthsaga was so funny. And it didn't, yeah, we didn't dig. You didn't hit his mouth, didn't hit. John Edwards is still his number one. How unexpected is that? How he told me he was going to get me in touch with John Howard, and I still not heard from him. With who? John Edwards, I mean, you said it the right a moment ago. And the psychic mother fucker Dan. Why the fuck do I feel worse than I did a few days ago? It's like a relapse. Yeah, I think you are relapsing. I'm sorry, that's not me. All right. Let's see here. Maybe he's not trying to be annoying, but we do have a lot today. I know, I almost, I was about to read that. Why do I type stuff in discord? Come on, you know. You said it out loud a minute ago. Yeah. I'm worth hearing. I don't know if I was heard. All right, we have a Teddy Frish classic bundles. If you guys are into that, just give a quick shout out to my people over at Teddy Frish.com. Oh, we have coffee from them. We've never done any sales on the classics before. This is the first time we're making bundles. You can get... Hmm. You can mix and match. Get the hoodie, get the pants, get the bag. And you can pick what you want. That's pretty cool. Look at this. That's so pretty. Pick the style, pick the size. Ooh. Pick the sweatpants, style and size. Air freshener. That's one size. One size fits all. You can choose, you have to get it. And then there's the gift tote bag which you can pick the color. And you got all that for it. 85. It was on 142, now it's 85. I don't know. That's awesome, I like that. That's nice. You know that, eh? I don't know where do you see that? If you go to Tertifresh, on page, passing bundle, I guess you just click it. Just go ahead and click. Oh, here it is. That's cool. We're all bundled up, folks. I like bundles. I love the classic collection. I think that's my favorite thing for Tertifresh. Thanks, dude. Me too, I love it. Get you through every time. Real quick, I have a $20 donation from Nathan as a counter offer. He'll come for $20 and he'll drive himself all the way from Canada and he'll cook us and it will be the most average ramen you've ever had. How much? 20 bucks. Where's he driving from? Canada. Canada. Yeah. All right. This seems like a way harder deal. I'm down, I'm in for that, I'm in for that. Okay. Get his info. Let's get him out here. By the way, I am not on Blue Sky. Apparently there's like 1,000 in poster accounts, including that they're being posted on like Hassan Piker subreddit, which is like a H-Slee snark adjacent subreddit now. I swear didn't we see a stat that like the hd snark and his son piker so read at like a 40% overlap or something. Yeah, I think we did see that. Here this is what they posted on I mean it's first it was posted 37 minutes prior and it has 36 points. So I don't know a lot of points, but it probably got a few hundred after you know because it's a new post and Okay. I mean, I think the more important thing is to just point out, this is a P, this is a PSA. You do not have a blue sky account. If you see somebody posting is that it is not associated with that. So anyway, apparently I wrote, the song fans need to get out of my community. Their progressive purity tests are a cancer on society. Hashtag, peace and love, Hashtag, A Street Street. You guys know I was Hashtag, peace and love, and H Street, you know my shit. Yeah. I could have believed it before the hashtags. Right. Yeah. The rest of that seems accurate to be honest, but... They title it me while I'm blue sky. Let me see. I mean, I know, I mean, there's still a lot of Hassan fans in this community who are like, somehow able to emotionally and spiritually navigate the space, which is fine. But like, all the militant psycho Hassan fans should definitely leave. And like, why wouldn't they? I think they're gone. Yeah. Mostly gone. I think they're gone. You know.

Anyway, here's a camey, camey, camey. is talking about two movies dominating the box offices right we got gladiator two and we got wicked I wonder which movie philp to Franco watch You didn't see glad he ate her cube. You let him watch the book. What did that was? I mean, he's right. He's not right when he's talking. He's dead on man. It's okay. That shit's good. You know what that's that is exactly what he's saying. You're not you're not you dude. You're not. You're too. He's getting you fucking dog shit with you. You're a man. Justifiably so that didn't see gladiator. You were watching. Did that come with a side of dick in your mouth. You know, you know what you guys are wrong. I heard there's a gay kiss and gladiator too. So hot. Oh, no, which pictures? Interesting. Gender, what's gender? Uh... Men on men, or... I think it's men on men. Fuck yeah. That's gay shit. I'm gonna hit this. I can't help it because I feel like shit. Okay. Where's the day calls for the ship, Tom? Day quail. Get you through the day. Be like me, baby. Oh, wow. Oh, didn't see glad he ate her too. You went and watched Wicked. I think he's kind of being silly. It reminds me of a Jack Black bit. I don't think he's being silly. I think he's being silly. I don't think so. No, I think he's a hundred percent clowning on Phil. Was you sarcastic too? Yeah, no, I think he's clowning on him. Dude, he is stuck in 2004 forever. Like, he just got it, like, just think back to 2001 watch. Dude, he's so right though, Phil, it is cringe. Dude, not that. I think I agree. I will probably see wicked before gladiator two. I'll go. Yeah. Yeah. He's been pretty fucking level had it. He has his takes have been pretty level had it. Cheers came. Cheers. You went and watched wicked. By all accounts, Wicked is like an incredible film, and it's a sequel to, I'm sorry, I'm gonna throw it out there right now. Bring the hate a sequel to an a very overrated movie the original gladiator no gladiator fuck you that movie's awesome. It's fine. It's fine. I don't think it's bad It didn't it definitely didn't need a sequel. Let's put it that way I agreed to need a sequel, but I don't know anything about the sequel, but the first movie was fucking awesome I love that movie Dan and you're a fucking it. It doesn't hold up. When's the last time you think I mean I thought maybe like 10 years Are you saying is it actual 10 years or what feels like 10 but it was really like 15 years? I watched it so much recently. Because I watched it like five years ago and I loved it when it first came out and I was surprised how awesome. There's some good performance. I'm not saying it's a bad. Buckingham, the Joker. Buckingham, Phoenix, was amazing. Has this psychotic sister fucking emperor? Yep. He was awesome. He's the man. I'm a real man, and I love gladiator and cringe that you don't like gladiator. Anyway, watch with Gip. I think it was awesome. I'm, games wedding me over. It didn't see glad he entered you. A speaking of, well, there's no relation. I can't make this for a related, but John that a Robert F. Kennedy RFK, he sold us this shit. Where did we even find this fucking video? A friend of mine got this as an ad and sent it to me the other day. So, Dan, drop this in the chat and I think it's bizarre. This video has like 400 views or a dead yesterday. No, it's very underground. It must be an ad, yeah. So that it's an ad of 2.5 times. Oh, it's getting out there. So here it is. That's impressive. After the cut, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, because he's fit, but he looks so unhealthy. Anyway, honey, why the fuck did this open? The shit was that, what the fredge? You think, you think it's okay for Teddy, you say what the fridge, you always ask me and he goes, can I say this? You can't say that effort, obviously. And then I say, what the frick, because I don't want to curse a phrase says, can I ever say what the frick, and I say, I think that's fine, you say what the frick at home. I think at home, I think it's fine here. I think at school, even at school, it's probably not that bad. They try not to say it at school, but I think what the frick is good. How about what the flip, what the flips find? Yeah. Lena's shaking her head at me not to say. Lena says, fudge. Oh, you think Freck is too vulgar? What the fudge? She won't say fuck. Yeah. I don't care much either. I always say silly words like that too. Yeah. That's what fun. Yeah. I curse too much. I definitely have a bad habit. But I'm not, I've decided I'm not going to shelter my children. I think the best way is for them to understand that it's adult language and that there's words that they're going to hear regardless, they're going to hear it in public, they're going to hear it in media, they're going to hear adult saying, yeah, social media. And they need to know that they cannot say those words, even though they hear them all the time. My dad always told me that I could curse, but never around him or any adults. Teddy, I love Teddy to curse. He's like, can I say it if I whisper to him? That's fun. And I thought about it, I say, yeah, I think that's okay. OK. So funny. Yeah. So we actually bought them.

I don't know. I feel like I ate her when you flip out of the center. But you, you went and watched with her. I'm so funny. Should we try the Robert of Kenny thing or maybe so try next next week? Interesting a little development here. I was I'm waiting to investigate this with you, but right as we went into that ad, I saw several people in the chat saying the ball CGI in that video. No, what's examined if that's true because he isn't he like Mr like conspiracy I don't think so. Well, let's find out. That would discredit him, like, so much, nothing he hasn't learned. Tell us. Okay, there is something very strange going on. It's not like a TV. Hold on. Oh, it's in front of the TV. No, no, hold on. Watch. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. And watch what happens when it cuts to black and white. Hmm. Play the conspiracy music. I don't see what you guys are talking about. Now watch what happens. It's like this cut the ball's gone. Who's a cut? It's out of frame. Hold on. Go for it. Watch again. Let me go and slow both. There's definitely a zoom in. Playback speed. Half. Here it is, damn. The shadow is a little weird too. The shadow's working. It looks a little off. I think it's real. I think it's real. I think it's in front of a TV and it's kind of like low res to begin with. Go back to the frame where it's black and white. Because I think you can see the string on the top of the bay. I think it's open. You know how to go frame by frame, right? Yeah. How's that shit? This string is... I mean, I've watched it slowly. I don't see it. Like, this part looked weird to me, but it's not in front of the TV. Well, why does this stop at 17? He's not done punching it. That's why I don't understand. That one didn't register. Perfect. Now, floor that one. You're right. Why did it stop? 16. 17. Is there really a TV component? Because ours was just the head. Yeah, but there might be like an advanced model. There's there's a QR code to download an app. There it is. I'm watching it on slow-mo in Premiere. I'm not seeing anything wrong. I think it's real. Okay. I think it's real. Right. Right before I arrived to play with the balls, I dropped off my corp. The corp is somewhat bare that I own over the all day weekend. I feel starting to suffer. I hit a ran over a bear and I had my wife harvest. It's what we're going to put it in a freezer later. Inside of the kidney, inside of the kidney we found a ring where we took out them for our mama hide and we're saving it for a delicacy for the e-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o I took the deer harvest. I took out the liver and I injected it annually. There's good research that says that the deer liver up the animal orifice. That's called a bird breath. It could actually help rejuvenate the or the animal lining. The ideal starting to suffer. No good. Go ahead then try it. Me? Yeah, you got it. I'm trying it before I did. It's fucking hard dude. I got one on. You got it on. Shoot. I feel like you got to stand up and be able to move around. The fact that it is just like a headband kind of is humiliating. It reminds me of like a headband dildo. It just hit me in the face. Come on, baby. Where's that boxing skills at? It's hard. It's very different. No, I'll get 17 of my first try. No test. No easy. Fuck my eyes and titties. Oh, over there. All right. So I've got I've got here. The headband. We are strapped up my friends. Okay. We've got a ball. Oh, is it too long? I feel like it's long. I rolled it up. I stand up. It should be right past your belly button. It's too long. Yeah, okay. Bear with us, guys, we are doing the bowling box and wrapping, wrapping. And got five, very watch out, RFK. Eat your heart out, RFK, you bitch. You bitch, man, motherfucker. Okay, this looks like the right. The idea is starting to suffer. That looks like the right, that looks right. Okay, I can get the hang of this. Okay. Oh, it's not made. I fucked it up. It's not coming from the back. I'm trying, wait, the light is right, mate. Okay. Okay. Okay. The ideals stuck in the stuff room. How keep what's to play? Done, you're out of frame. Anyway. Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right. Okay, Dan. I don't know what's to play so bad. Here, Ducky. Here, Ducky. You want to play? You're a show, Ducky. Ducky, you want to play? Yeah, you're probably. I think you are, Dan. All right. I'm starting to feel like feverish. I know. This beaver box, whatever the fuck it's called. You want to play with this beaver box, Ducky? We have a tennis ball too. So would you take this as a sponsor? Sure, I'll take their money. Cool. Anyway. I'll reach out to them in Swedish, maybe. Maybe they'll work out. I actually met the owners of B-box, really good people. They sat around the campfire and shared the intestines. You got seven? Let me see. Two, three, four, five. Oh, Dennis is untouchable. He's the undisputed B-box share. Boom, boom, boom. Oh, dude. Cheers! We sat around a campfire and shared the intestines of a blue whale. It was so big, you could crawl inside and stitch it in. They're actually quite large. The intestines of a blue whale is quite large. We pitched a tank and started eating it from the inside. Daniel, you're the best. The ideal stocking stuff. Is that really the ideal? There you go. Is that really the ideal stock stocking stuff? It doesn't barely fit. It's a big square. You know what I mean? I'm hot. Alright, let's move it on. We have more. Okay, okay, you're fine. This is an interesting story. And you guys, I'm curious what you think. Hot ones turned down a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris. And I was like, that's my snap call was that. That seems somewhat scandalous. Like, that seems like someone had their foot on the scale there. So, I think they would have, yeah. Well, after looking more into it, the producers said that they don't want to have any politics on the show. I think it's smart. Do nobody cares? Are you fucking kidding me? Kamala Harris, who says no to that? I think I wouldn't even praise you. That would have been insane, dude. You don't want to seek the potential president, eat a fucking death wing? Yep, I mean, yeah. I think Kamala, I think she can handle the spicy food, and she will look bad ass. I think it was, I think it was a political thing. I think they're maga. Generally. They said they've been doing the show for however long they've never once had a political episode and they just want to stay away from it. Dude, I am sorry, but that's bullshit. If the fucking vice president presidential candidate comes and says, can I do your show? You say yes. That is a joke. First thought was I was like damn the last thing I heard about him in terms of like scandal was not long ago, February. I looked it up in 2024. It was, do you remember it was announced that he was dating that porn star in the day later? He broke up with her after it became public. And I was like, huh? Kind of maga. Loki. I mean, listen. I know Sean Evans. I mean, it's been a while since we talked about a very nice guy, very motivated, talented guy. But obviously I don't know. And I mean, he's not the only one there making decisions either, I don't think. He's a partner there who's like the EP. Well, I also met really nice talented good dude. I remember when we talked to him, he was trying to have a kid. So I wish him I hope he did was able to. He's talked to me. Was he able to pro-create? Oh, maybe I actually even look. That seems kind of. I mean, I know he was trying. I'd like to congratulate him. Can you work? I know it also he doesn't own the IP and he's talked about that in the past that he doesn't have full creative control right? Yeah, but stuff like that. At this point I'm pretty sure that he's like fully hooked up now. Yeah, I watched an interview. I don't know when it was from, but I remember him talking about all that kind of stuff. But okay, I don't know. Found that kind of weird. I was think of Jordan saying Republicans by Jordan's two when he wanted to stay out of politics. But do you really think that people would be like, oh, I'm not watching the show. No, they weren't fucking care. I think so. I think they were. Like, let's say we didn't talk about politics. Imagine what it would be. Just flying high in the sky. Well, you're saying, imagine if you weren't you, Ethan, you know, imagine what if I didn't exist. Uh, that's one way of taking it. Um, both the West Wing and the chicken wings eluded the Harris campaign. I'll be the initial hot ones turned down the opportunity to interview them. Presidential candidate. Yada Yada, we know who she is. Top generals of Harris decidedly unsuccessful, Persian campaign gathered on the liberal leaning pod save America to analyze the menus for the losses. Side comment, but I saw his son is hosting pod save America. And I find that just incredible that these established Democrats, I don't know if they don't understand or I think they don't understand. They haven't looked into it. Hassan is anti-democratic party. He's actively working against the interests of the Democratic party. I feel like, especially during this last campaign. And I find it fucking interesting that they're having a pro-terrorist fucking anti-liberal. He hates liberals. He hates them. I've seen him say it so many times and they keep like bringing him on their programs. It's fucking insane. And I think a lot of it has to do with Twitter, not Twitter, Twitch's white washing of his reputation. But there's plenty of time to address all that. All in due time, my friends. What am I watching? What is this on the screen? Alright, let's get out of here. Looks like we're damned though. Dan, you're damned. It's still going, come and cut to Dan, please. We got him as a pit. The bottom left. Oh, we have him. Okay, good. What's your best once before Dan? You did, you did. Wow. Where's your room of ex? Oh, good. You're taking a, oh shit. Oh fuck. That was big. And how's your arm feeling? Are you getting exercise or? No, nothing. Not a lot of motion. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. Um, deja vu last Friday. Oh, great. People are making fun of me again. Great. Oh, great. deja vu. Yeah, this was pretty funny actually. I feel like this happens a lot on the show, where I'll talk about the same exact thing multiple times. But this one is quite good. Do you guys know about that? Absolutely. It's an amphibian. And it has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It has an amphibian. It That's the savings actually. Did you guys know about the axolado? No. It's an effibian. It has longs and gills. Wow. Pretty cool. Where's it from? Mexico. Oh, cool. Yeah, a lake in Mexico. And what's what state can't you own in it? Everyone? California. Just Cali and one other state. I'm declaring victory. I got like 23 right there. I'm just as qualified. I've been trying to get this guy to call in. Justin Waller, please call him. He's asked on this coffee hour bullshit. It was the last time he cried. And he of course has a really thoughtful moving answer. Oh, for somebody else. that you cried. When they're retarded, get hit those stories. It's literally like a clip from a comedy, like, well, feral movie or something. The last time I cried was when that. Can I say it? If I'm, no. No? No. Yeah, just don't. Come on. Okay. What the fuck? He cried when they're, when they're retarded, get hit those stories. Yeah, here we go. If you want me to cry, it's going to be at a joy for somebody else. See if somebody achieves something after they try to real hard. The odds of you see me like Boo Boo Cryer. I like you call them a R word if you respect them so much. Exactly. Yeah. There has been a time in the past five years that you've cried out of sadness. 10 years. No? Bro, I don't think you guys understand the child. What kind of conversation is this? Who gives a fuck when he cried? Like, we're grown-ass. We're grown-ass by the fuckers. Like, people are not crying readily. I mean, I do cry. Cry when shredder died. You know what I mean? I'm sure lots of people have different reasons to cry. What is this conversation? You know? You're telling me you didn't cry when your father walked out on your family when you were nine. That's the only way you end up like this. no offense. That probably is true. That's my theorem. All these guys straight up that issues. There's mom issues and there's dad issues. This is dad issues. I think that dad issues is like the need to be this ultra successful, this perception of like wealth. and dignity and ultramasculine. It's like, Dad, aren't you proud of me? Isn't this so what you always want to mean? Are you, are you, are you proud of me now, right, Dad? Now that I've become a man that you can respect, it's very sad. The mommy issues is like serial killers. Those are the guys who like kill women or our word women are just like disgusting fucking pickup artists in general. These are mommy issues you get people. I want to make I'm telling you, I know what I'm talking about. Mom, I want a baby. Dad, I know what the fuck I'm saying. So what's what are you? What type of issues do I have? That's right. You love, you have a great relationship with your parents. I think you, I think you, you have great parents by the sound of that. terrific, uh, came from a nice warm, uh, Emily Hobbe. Cool one. Does anyone want to share their mommy or daddy issues? I got a few. Okay. I have some, obviously, I have some daddy issues, but you guys all know about that. But nothing too extreme. I think I made out of it pretty good. What about you, baby? You actually want to talk about it or no? No, no. I wouldn't trade my parents right then. There's some issues. They both didn't have fathers, so they kind of... That kid's themselves. Generational, man. It really is. But you've really come through and you're a very high, I'll say this. You're a very high character young man. Thank you. You've done quite well. Thank you, thank you. You went and watched Wicked. There is that, though. You know, all these people who come from super dysfunctional families. without a mom, or a dad, or fucked up, abusive drug using, or whatever, whatever, molesting, whatever, fucked up that you could imagine. All these kids coming up from, these, like, good, nice, normal parents that love them and support them. You're playing on different modes, man. It's not your fault. You're playing on different, different life difficulties. It's not your fault. So just know that I love you if you did. Not your fault. And I'm with you. Yeah, I want you to understand that Dan internalized that. It's not your fault. I'm not your fault. When you keep addressing me, whether it's going on? Not your fault. It's not your fault. All this Dan? I know you keep mistaking me for your dad, but I'm not. My dad has made data major additions. As you guys know, he was really tragic honestly. His biological dad walked out on him when he was like, like, night. and never talk to them again. And lived in the same city and made a new family. That was crazy. How fucking insane is that, yes? That was crazy. And he didn't have the means to take care of them if you wanted to. Oh yeah, he was wealthy. Yeah. That was crazy. So I can't even imagine. I told him that. Not your fault. My dad has one memory of his dad, and it's, I remember hitting him with a broom once and telling him, stay away from my mother, you son of a bitch. That was the only memory my dad had was stopping my grandfather from touching my grandmother. Really? How old was he? Yeah. He was, I think he was four or five. It's a fair man that people have to go through that. It really is. Just find for rights for a long time. Yeah, yeah. Upstanding since four years old. You know, I do have a theory though that I think in general. I'll talk specifically about men just because I don't know much about. I think mom is generally have a pretty good track record, but I think dads are becoming better at being dads over time. As this idea of masculinity, becoming less rigid and less stereotypical, like you have to be this way. You can't hug your kid. You can't tell your kid you love them. You can't be like this in that and that with your kid. And as these barriers are torn down, I think. Kids are having better relationships with their dads, which is good, obviously, for everybody. I hope so, because if they're not there, then there's the Andrew Tates and all them out there who are gonna take advantage of them and ruin their lives. Fortunately, he's coming in where the dads have failed. The ones that have failed. Yeah. Yeah. I think the break, break the cycle mentality is really strong with people right now. I think it's happening. I think it's a lot of people right here. Can we get some AC going? Let's see blah blah blah. Yadiyada. Jordan Peterson did an interview with Jay Shetty, what a reminder. He let Jay probably, it's like an hour and a half long. You probably let Jay talk for about three minutes. That's my man. Yeah. That's how you conduct an interview. At the opening, does mean at least to some degree, always asking... Can you imagine he once the last time you raised your grandmother's cubes to gently glide across a canvas? This seems very on Jay Shetty to talk to Jordie. I feel like this is Jay Shetty's biggest... Oh, what do I have to give up? This steak. Like, ever. Like, he is not inclusive. He hates trans people. He's like mega conservative. You know, like the vibes are not there. Unless this was like a mega debate about like things. It's not like the opposite. It's a glazed dude. The juicer. Let's help in some time. So let me see the intro. What do I have to let go of? What do I have to transform? That could be very painful. There isn't anything better that you can do with failure, no matter how on just. Then to learn from one of the most articulate man of our time. Then it goes to that Theo Vaughan. What are you doing, Jay? I mean, I like Theo Vaughan, but like, what do we do in here? He's not like, you know, the fuck in the spiritual leader or something. Maybe he is, I don't know. 200 from Captain. Dillster, thank you so much. Hey, they're watching for 11 years. You've got me through my dog passing. And my 4.5 relationship break up year break up. And I lost 40 pounds alongside your weight loss. I don't have a top of years of school. I about to graduate. I hope this is a payback for all the content over the years. Ethan and crew of Dill and thank you, man. I don't even have to go. The payback is the nice, it's the nice message and it's just the fact that you're watching. That's all I ever need. I appreciate it so very much. That's very special. Good job. Good job. We're private years, man. Let's keep the goal in, baby. Ecology has turned. Culture warrior. Go to Jordan, Peterson. So he does. So he does. He's a culture warrior, and you brought him on. First short-term mating opportunities are. It's like, when I look at this, it's acupilian and sadistic. So one of the unintended consequences of the sexual revolution is that the freed-up women have been delivered to the psychopathic men. Most people who have post-traumatic stress disorder don't have it because they were hurt. They have it because they encountered someone who wanted to hurt them. People can go through all sorts of... What a strange statement. Why are we splitting hairs on that one? Um, let me go to the timestamps. By the way, in 30 minutes, we have the BBC interview guy who got razz by Logan. He's calling in. Yes, he is. That's pretty exciting. Razz, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, razzledad, r Just they continue to rise this way. Should I just sit in your chair and pretend to be you. I'll see if he doesn't know. I'd be so mean. It's terrible. Let's just put the pillow there. Let's see how Jordan just sandwiches people. It's called that section. Okay. Eagle paths. I mean, I use some rules online when I'm dealing with comments. If you're anonymous, you're questionable. If you're anonymous with a demonic name, you're definitely questionable. The funs in the botic name. Well, I mean, there are people watching the Lord of the Fly is as your handle, then yeah, I mean, I don't see names that much, but it's like, okay. That doesn't feel particularly common online, but I don't know, maybe I'm... What if anonymous accounts have names that are loose a variant? You know, shot. Really? Do a dispatcher. There's no fucking way that's true. I'm sure there are some, but what? No, I guess that's part of the edginess. If you use LOL, L-M-F-A-O, if you use the rice of names, those are all indications of bad actors. L-O-L? LMAO, LMAO, LMAO, LMAO. What does that have to do with being a bad actor, man? Jay Shetty, you got no pushback for that? He's nodding along, he's like, yep. You can't be sitting there in a green with this fucking psychopathy, man. No. I think you're nodding, yes, to that. He said, low means if you lose low and then you're psychopath and you nodded. to characterize the bad actor space quite clearly. He do that with diagnostic criteria, but we have this situation now where the social media spaces are. overwhelmingly tilted in a negative direction by the predatory psychopaths. Do you believe that things are as divided as they see? No, I know they're not. That's yeah, they're speaking with one of my friends today. I know they're not as divided, but every time I open the comments, 70% of them have devilish names and say, well, and I wish they would all die. Not like a violent way, but in like a rapture way, I wish Jesus would just come back and collect the souls of the damned and deliver them to Satan where they belong. You guys want to order? Oh, yeah, I'll take that. You don't want it. That off space. Are you sure? Can I, can I pay for it? She, she offered me it as well. She's not paying for it. She's not valued. Being nice. But she has been nice, which you know. You are so kind, but no. I need to like, I don't know. I'm not, I'm just trying to make sure I make it through that episode, guys. Guys. Thank you so much. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Fucking chomperino, bro. I'm for it. Chess says, Aloo stands for Love of Lucifer. Oh, my God. I haven't got it. Whoa. That's scary. A little more bite, little. All right, listen. Our friend Matt Shay, the BBC reporter is calling in in a little under half an hour. If we want to get to our headline stories today, we probably need to do one sooner than last shot. I would have to finish this. I love Jordan and Jay Shetty. We go to the next one. After this, I'll move on. The guys that are just out for a good time, they're not much fun. And they're... How do you know? A lot worse than you think, and the worst of them are so much worse than you think that if you ever go to look inside your, their mind, you would never recover. And I'm not saying that lightly. It's not pleasant. This guy's a cycle analyst. The way he talks about relatively normal people. I'll say this in Jordan's defense. He hates Andrew tape. He's vocal, that's nice. That's what that's actually a W. At least he's consistent, you know what I mean? Yeah, that's fair. And then, he probably just hates him because he fucked his father. I had to say it for it. Something tell me how it's all going to do with it. Sarah Quintero says, thank you so much for that donation. Peace and love Ethan and H3 Crow. Ethan will watch since Vapination days. Vapination. No. Never stop watching since. It's also my 26th birthday today and I'm watching from Disney. Yeah, from Disneyland. Wait, go and join yourself. But hey, can I get a 26th fuck you from Zach? Yeah, yeah, Zach, cook them up. It's all right, Disneyland. Twenty-six. Fuck you. That was very nice. Wow, very nice. Thank you so much. Thank you. I hope you have a beautiful, lovely day here. The worst of terrible people are so bad. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making this up. I'm not making They haven't because they encountered someone who wanted to hurt them. Right? And so it was that glimpse of that malevolence that fractured them. How could you know that? What a weird adult. Wait, wait, wait. Actually, play a little bit more. People go through all sorts of horrible things and not be traumatized. You know, a terrible illness, terrible pain, and accident, you wait till you tangle with someone who's malevolent. Boy, what about shell shop? Like, you don't see the people. It's a bunch of exposure. This seems like, I mean, he's the psychologist here. This seems like a gross, over-generalist. Is he still, I think he was dis? Yeah, maybe he's not legally. He was trained as the psychologist, right? He was a PhD in psychology. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So, you know, I suppose he... He has credentials. He has some credentials here. But if he lost his license, then me strikes me as a pretty shocking, uh, assertingly narrow. My therapist would beg to differ. I think both would. That might be DSD is from what happened, not the decision to do what happened. Right. Right. Closer. Maybe you need to listen to Jordan more. I think you're, I should, I should send this link to my therapist. I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I will not be the same person afterwards assuming you managed to put yourself back together at all. So this is not and it's it's many of those people too that have free reign online. It's not a good thing. You brought up identity and I feel that so much of our. If you want to keep watching, I was baffled by this earlier because The direction like we all just heard with Jordan says the direction that Jay goes with this I was like what the fuck you bab like Jay seems dumber than Jordan I gotta be honest I didn't say that subscription to ideas of identity are somewhat subconscious and I'm not sure anyone's ever at least not that I know, the scale of people who are thinking about their life in a logical way to say, let me think about what my identity is. I think we join communities, we join groups, we leave communities, we leave groups, we sign up to this, we unsubscribe from that. We don't even recognize that we're subconsciously crafting an identity by the people we spend time with and the people we listen to it often, isn't it? Yeah, it isn't. You said nothing. And what does this have to do with Jordan? I was like, oh, where's your Allen? Right. So Jordan, like, doesn't pause. So I think it was referencing something prior, but it was like so much earlier. Because he was just filibustering all the time. Okay, fair enough, fair enough. Okay, really, you got to move on. Yeah, I mean, like that didn't, that was jarring. That wasn't, he just completely changed the topic all of a sudden. But okay, whatever. As, uh, in that case, stories, by the way, that's, that's a good observation. I mean, that was really, I just thought it was on how Jay just went off in a completely new direction in response to all that. If you like, there's a lack of self-awareness with the title of the video. It says how to spot. That's a little bit more. How to spot hidden manipulators. I feel like that's both of them. I'm seeing two on screen right now. Well, it's just if they say LOL or true Romeo. Jay Shetty, you never typed LOL, you got to let him shit on you like that. of the domain sub-thought that I've been wondering in no I do have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot Part of my training, I did something similar with the Bhagavad Gita, which is the text of the East, and it's similar, there's a conversation between the Divine Krishna or God, with Arjuna, who's an archer, who has lost all self-belief and self-esteem, because he's having to fight his family. He's an archer. Yes, he knows. He means to miss the target. It's an archer. And then means to miss the target. Uh-huh. Look into that. Again, I'm assuming he's talking about Latin. Because that's a cardinal sin. I feel like there's no shot. That's true. How could you pack that much meeting in the three words? I don't remember. Missing the mark is a concept in Christianity in Judaism that comes from an archery term. The Hebrew word for sin means missing the mark and the New Testament. He's right. He's right. He's right. Yeah. He's just trying to find his is opening to take back control. Don't try and don't try and get into a biblical archetype off with Jordan Peterson man. That is he is thinking about that. That is the mark with that one. You might say that. You might say that. I don't know right there. Okay. Interesting. That notion of sin has that archery connection in multiple different languages. And so it's the same theme that you're describing. And the reason for that is an archer hits the target, right? So to hit the target accurately is to pursue the divine most appropriately. So there's a metaphysics of archery. So that's definitely not a that's not that's a good example of how there's that's right. There's no His eyes are ravaging. God, gorgeous. I just, I was walking. You're grip on the bow. You won't aim rock. There's almost no failure regardless of how arborated. I just found this interesting. They put a preview right after the code. There's a preview in the beginning of the video coming up. And then made up so while Jordan's talking, they put a preview what he's gonna say later on. Y'all think he's that boring? What are you doing? I mean, maybe. That's an interesting format. We should pull it out. He was right before their ad break. That's very like. We're happy to say we bury our infinite. Let me see what. Oh, Jordy's not pulling in the views. That's actually surprising. That didn't do that well for him. Usually Jordan gets big views. But Jay Shady has never had views. That's the thing. He doesn't. He doesn't. He doesn't. I think he's big like Facebook. Yeah, so I'm curious how much this got on his other platform. Yeah. Yeah. Jordyn's probably big on Facebook. He had Tom. Yeah, Tom word on. Tom. Hey. Oh, the other Tom. This fucking guy. Those are the only two. These are really a lot on these ones, man. Not good over my wife. Nobody's interested in Jordan. That's like his lowest view at episode of Wild. Oh, you have Fadjo. Fadjo. Except for Fadjo. Talk about the janky curves. There's such a funny clip of Fadjo where it looks like he has put the shoes on the wrong foot. It's going to point me out for a second. All right. Thank you. Oh. Wow. I like the glimpse into you really sat across from from Joker and didn't say anything, huh? You know, yeah, the joke is interesting. He's got, he's interesting guy, but he's crazy. Literally. He's become a big Joker. Literally. You got to call him out. I just killed a bunch of people and I'm the Joker. All right, where are we at? Church. Uh, our friend is calling in here at, in like 15 minutes. Yeah. So if you got anything short, we've got the, uh, man, kind of a lot. Mm-hmm. Kaisenat. Which I'll do after the call cause I want to give it it's full look at there. Uh-huh. After that we've got Drake, Silling Kendrick, or no, he's Silling ULMG. You don't know about that in 15 minutes. There's not like a huge thing but it's an update to this whole storyline that's been running this year. It's season. I don't want to say about other than that like it's pathetic and like the coping is insane. It's just so pathetic, bro. What are you doing? You want to explain what's going on for anybody that hasn't been following? Yeah, I'll read this. I give you a fast rundown if you guys want. It just basically there was two lawsuits. The first one was saying that Spotify was, or the record label was pushing views, or sorry, it's Spotify. We're pushing views for Kendrick Song. And then the one today was saying basically that as a defamation lawsuit saying that they promoted him being a sex offender when he wasn't. So they're suing the label for defamation, but not Kendrick. But specifically for Kendrick, calling him a pedophile in his son. So he did call the pedophile to be fair. I mean, he did do that. Well, no, he said he said certified love or boy certified pedophile. He said pedophiles. Oh, you're right, you're right. All right, it's more that his organization. Yeah, I understand it. There are sex offenders in his crew. Interesting. Yeah, so Drake is on Republic and Kendrick is on Innerscope, both are under UMG. So he is suing the company that he's been with in his whole career. Yeah. Interesting. But yeah, he says that they knowingly because they know him and they know that he's not a pet a file. Oh, they know that. I would your label know you're not a pet a file. Your defense of that shit was I'm too famous to be a pet a file. He don't know. Nobody knows anything, Drake. That is what he said. Which is kind of wild. Drake has launched a second legal action against universal music group, using defamation falsely claiming him of being a sex offender. I think that there is some wiggle room to say it wasn't about him. It was just about his crew. I didn't find it. You're weird. He's suing the label and not Kendrick. I think this is a way for him to avoid being called a bigger bitch online. Because he's a suit country. Yeah. People are like, you're so salty. It's a rat battle you lost, you know? It isn't. Any would have gotten, I think, even harder on it. 100%. It isn't even really a lawsuit. It's a pre-action filing aimed at taking depositions from key figures at UMG, which might support Drake's accusations in a future lawsuit. Oh, I don't know necessarily. So maybe he is planning on swimming Kendrick eventually after the depositions or something or it's all just a PR move to repair his image by seeming like he's fighting back legally, you know, people will take that as like, oh well, he must be innocent because he's like going after these people. He's being a bitch. I mean, both could be true. Both could be true. Both could be true. I mean, both could be true. That's just, yeah, straight bitch shit. But after I think him going on XQC stream was like, they're preemptively, hopefully get the internet on his side. That's what he was hoping. But I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. I think that's what he thought. When I play the poker game on the sex, I'm going to be like, I need the max weed. And I'm going to be super racist and like, oh, really? Is that racist? The Anita went, Anita max wed. I don't think so. He's doing like a Hispanic old lady. Yeah, that's certainly what it is. He's saying her name. Yeah. Exactly, he's saying he's saying he's saying he's a need of. But I don't know if you don't say without an accent, it's not an issue. It's just that one click did that. He has a character, he's painted it. He's like, Merch with this little, I think new tour is called the Anita Max win like World Tour or something. But real? What the hell is that on the, excuse me, stream? It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just this coping of being like, oh, yeah, you were getting bots on your song. The song that's been like trending in the top 100 for like a year. Plus, which was obviously the pop of the summer, nobody denies it. Why is he even trying to proclaim like that it was bought it? Like we all, we've been hearing that song everywhere. Nobody's bought it. Oh, so after the lawsuit, I think the song went back up to a top five. That made it also coincided with the album coming out. No, I know, but just in general, it probably boosted his numbers on stream platforms a little bit. But you're right. I'm sure there's like a strides and effect going on with this. Just like, oh yeah, I'm being reminded of that song. I'll go listen to it. Do filing filed on Monday, May public Tuesday claims UMG potentially funneled payments to eye heart as part of a pay to play scheme to promote the song on radio. Bro, what are you doing? So I will say that like the music industry doing shady stuffs and pay all of that, that definitely does happen. But in this instance, The popularity of that song felt very organic. If this, you know what I mean? The top trending and none of us had ever heard it, note about it. Yeah, I'd be like, okay, that is interesting. Yeah, but it was like a cultural phenomenon. Like, I don't think it. All of Drake's ears were, we're singing it. He knows, he's well aware. He did it. He did it like five times back to back at his pop out. Yeah, right. Well, at that point, it was like already a sensation. Yeah, I don't know. Drake's lawyers say they already have enough evidence to pursue claim for defamation against UMG, but they may also tack on claims of civil fraud and racketeering. Based on what they discovered from the depositions, Amar is not named as a respondent in the filing and is not legally accused of any wrongdoing. Oh, they, they, they want to do this too, by the way, because doesn't, like, especially taking the defamation angle, like, is he opening himself up? He's, the, the reverse history is opening himself up for discovery as well. Yes. And that seems like something he probably doesn't want to do. They can prove that he was knowingly employing like a, a bed of filer, something that kind of, And it's true, you can't, you can't defame somebody with true information. And like you said, he, Kendrick, that was smart. He didn't directly call him that. He called the organization, pedophile. You know, if I'd love her, boy, certified pedophiles. Right. Right. That's what it said, right. Just proceeding. So if I'd love her, boys certified pedophiles. Because he was talking about OVO. If I'd love her, boys could, yeah, just be the whole OVO organization. He's talking to everybody. Yeah, exactly. So I don't know. He's saying y'all are sketchy, characters. I don't think he's got, I think he, I think the plural thing gets him. He might be hoping for a settlement, because for the label to win the lawsuit doesn't make win the money thing, because he's still under them. If that makes sense, because they want him to not look bad, too. Well, that's kind of, I think, and that is, I have sort of this angle suggesting I don't know nearly enough about the industry to know if this could be possible, but he may be a speed trying to get out from his contract. Right. aren't notoriously, you know, very difficult. That's true. Just using this as leverage to get out from under UMG, essentially. Yeah, that could be true. Could be. That was the label's best option would be just for this to stop. Right. Does that make your money on both sides? No, they don't want one side to stop. Right. Yeah. And the label correctly pointed out it's like, we have no vested interest in making one of our biggest artists look bad. Yeah. Looks like you're on our label. That's fine. They have a financial incentive to not do that if anything, so it seems very fun to see. Yeah. Is our boy here? Nope, not yet. We said in five minutes. Okay. We have a copyright lawsuit because I was telling you guys, I won. I won the Compromise. Yay! I've done it. I honestly have a bit of a... A team star has been real quiet about that. A team star, I won the Compromise. I got nothing. I paid $50 per view, which came out to like $3,000. You're probably saying that you didn't see. You paid them now. That's what he's going to say. You're bailing with a jail. That's true. You are not going to jail. He says that he could go to jail for this. Yeah, he's incorrect on that one. And he says I'll get $0 millions of dollars. No, just $3,000. And they were begging us to let it go. Right. They were the ones asking us, please just drop. Let us get out of this. Yep. Because like he pointed out, I was ready to go to the mat with them. I was like, all right, let's do discovery, bitch. We had a whole, you know, we were ready. But that one's gone. I had the defamation muscle, which is the last one, which is in the court of appeals. We were scheduled to have a hearing on December 10th. My lawyer says he's never seen this happen before. It was removed from the calendar, and it was not rescheduled. When she thinks is a good sign, because it means they're looking into it deeply. Because if they were going to side with him and say, no, he's right. I'm going to side with the previous judge. They wouldn't need to dig that deep, right? Right. That's his logic. But either way, it does mean that these judges are Um, they already are taking like an extraordinarily long amount of time, even without taking it off the docket. Yeah, when did this all begin again? 2021. I mean, you're three of this. Yeah. And so this is like a civil thing. How does that work? It's not just right. So is there a couple of judges that decide on the pellet court? There's three judges. Okay. But the thing is they're taking so long. I think it means that they see like some presidential importance to this case because there is a lot going on there which makes me think that as my attorney and also apparently Ryan's attorneys think that this might go to this California Supreme Court. You're gonna end up in another law book after all this was done. Oh, I already will be in the if it's at the appellacard is a big deal If it doesn't go to the if it doesn't grow without here set in precedents left and right everybody's very busy. Well, we'll see hopefully I said a good precedent not a bad person right through Yeah, the a public court judgment is a big deal, so that would definitely be in the record. A Supreme Court would be a massive deal. Yeah. So is pellet under Supreme Court directly under is the right one between? No, it's a pellet and then Supreme Court. Shit. But the pellet court is a big deal. Yeah. Got it. That's crazy. So either, they say, actually, we side with Ryan and we grant and we deny your anti-slap, which means we go all the way back to the beginning and go back to writing briefs on God. So that happens, man. You probably have several more years ahead of you. I said Jesus. Oh, and then if they say, we grant the slap, then it is effectively done. That's GG. But they have, they can appeal to the Supreme Court, which I'm sure they will do. The Supreme Court only takes like 2% of appeals. Sure. So odds are they won't take it, but again, it seems like there's a chance they might, I don't know. But I don't even know when this hearing is happening now. I don't know, man. I just hope Ryan brings back the failure podcast, and I miss it. I miss it. I did. We need to season two. Ryan, please. I mean, pay well done skill house. Yeah. The first step is just the first eight minutes he pay well for five bucks. There's still no second episode of $5 for five dollars. That's one dollar per minute almost. When did, when did Bryce Hall come on? Was that him? That was, so let me look it up, that was a while ago. Because he had already, when he came on our show, they had films go house, like a long time before, right? Like, that was way in the past. And I feel like, March 2023 so going on to have going on two years and then the actual principal photography was done like maybe a year before that so and so far we have eight minutes of finished product yet this guy's lives in a mansion And it's joe awesome. Tremendous success. The most popular. The coolest. The coolest. Oh, the coolest. It came short tweeted apology. What is this? I just saw this tweet. The way it's formatted insane. I thought it was dying. Jack. What? This is probably the funniest shit I've ever seen. This is so funny. Jack is such nice. He was diagnosed. It looks like he's dying. Oh, look at that. Oh, look at that. Jack has cancer. What the fuck dude? What is that? Diagnosed. I love the the drum alert overlay. That is crazy. That's so funny. What? Okay, I mean, someone's gonna make for each of them. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. That is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. Oh my god. I really got it. I like read it over a few times. I just like shaking it in my reading the thread. Oh my lord. I like to know where info. What kind of spectrum are we on? And where do we say it? What kind? Tell me everything. You'll probably talk about it on a upcoming video. I imagine autism. Now that. It was a cool diet, right? It is. Why is that George G. So go autism? There's regulators. Yeah, it's not anything like autism at all. I think you knew that, though. I think you, I think you might have known that. You're doing a little joksy. Our guest, Matt She, from the BBC, is in the lobby. Very good. Would you like to for the for the for the for the Graham set this up a little bit? yesterday we watched a video of Logan Paul rising BBC reporter was investigating some of the crimes Logan Paul has been accused of crypto rug polls chiefly and this reporter came all the way from England to Puerto Rico to interview him and Logan instead of meeting him had him meet with a fake Logan Paul actor, which is kind of a weird and bad idea when someone's invests like a big media corporation is investing in an actual crime you've committed. Yeah, generally. So we've got the reporter who he razzed and I'm very curious to see what he has to say about the whole thing. Oh, there he is. It's Matt Shea, everybody. Wow. Thank you. Matt, we were thinking of bringing on a fake Ethan, but I just wouldn't do that to you. Well also, I think I'd be able to tell quite quickly because I did a tiny bit of background research and I know what you look like. You're good. I see why you work for the BBC. So tell me, Logan edited that video and he made it look like he got you pretty good. What was your experience versus being there versus how he kind of conveyed the experience? Well, I mean, to set the theme first of all, You know, this is an unprecedented thing for the BBC, right, to be kind of trolled in this way. I flew to Puerto Rico, to ask him some very specific questions about specific allegations, to do with various financial products that he had promoted. And his, and I get there. And the first thing I noticed was like, there's a bunch of cameras pointed at us. And so I was pretty, you know, it was pretty obviously he was going to try and get some kind of onto out of it. And then, yeah, sat down. And as soon as that guy walked through the door, I could obviously tell it wasn't Logan Paul. I mean, for a second, it was like I thought like, you know what I was like, celebrities look kind of worse in real life when they don't have the magic of the cameras and stuff. I thought, you know, it would be so awkward if I, if I call them out immediately. And it is Logan Paul, but then I did quite, like pretty instantly, I just started laughing. Um, and yeah, then I, when I saw his video, he was saying things like, oh, he's mats like more than ever since he was just constantly sipping water. It's like, I was literally just sipping water because it's hot. It's in Puerto Rico. Yeah, he definitely edited it to make it look like he's like, oh my god, we got him. You really believe me. Look at him. He's sipping water. Yeah, he tried hard to make that look like a thing. For sure. Yeah, absolutely. And then, of course, the craziest thing he did was when I called him out and said, you know, you're obviously not looking bullets leave, he sent a kind of hoard of his supporters who chanted through microphones, the BBC are pedophiles, and they photoshopped, you know, my face next to Hugh Edwards, a BBC presenter who's been charged with sexual crimes, and it's like, Dude, just answer the question. You could have just sat and answered or responded to the allegations. It doesn't actually scream innocence when you send a look-alike to your own internet. Certainly not. And especially he paints it as like, I'm following in the footsteps of my idol, the great, the innocent, and you take. Right, exactly. I mean, there was a direct reference to Tate in that he had one of his guys at a black card with me holding a box of chocolates, which is a famous meme that Tate created because he asked me to bring him a box of chocolates to an interview, which, you know, we can get into that, but it's a pretty big tangent. But anyway, in doing so, he was, whether he realized that it or not, aligning himself with Andrew Tate's kind of campaign to to discredit me, the BBC and our documentary. I mean, in his response piece, he said that the documentary was based on unfairified information. So I was surprised that he chose to align himself with NUT because ultimately, you know, the things that Logan Paul is being accused of which he denies and he wrongdoing for. A lot of people think that they're very serious crimes, but compared to the things that Andrew Taylor's being accused of, those are far, far worse. And if Logan Bull had come out and just had some courage instead of using this diversionary trolling tactic and sad and answered the questions, I think it would have been a lot better for his reputation rather than doing what he did. So how does it, how does it mean you see handle that? I mean, you guys flew out there. Did you fly out there or did a crew fly out there? You hired local people, maybe. Both. Yeah, I flew out there with my director and there was local crews that we employed there as well. So what do you do? You arrive. And then when you realize you got pumped, you just go back home. You just, you know what I mean? Just like, okay, well, that was a waste of time. go back home thinking that in a way reveals far more than any interview could have because you know I could have sat there and, you know, grilled him on every single allegation that we had and he could have responded with the denials that his legal team had prepared. But by sending a look like he sort of showed that he's not really willing to engage, he doesn't really care or it seems to care. He's keen to use this kind of diversionary tactic of talking about allegations against the BBC that I have nothing to do with. So to me, that was more revealing than anything. So I came back thinking, wow, this has actually been great. I mean, it would have been worse if say the prank had worked. And I actually thought it was Logan Paul. that, you know, that could have been awkward. But it, that's not how it felt. I was literally just laughing and like this guy's clearly not Logan Paul and then I left. It was, it was really awkward for him because he was nervous too that look like, I suspected he had an earpiece because he just wasn't really talking. Yeah, he did. Confidently. By the way, we know that look like he came, we did a, a gag where we had Logan Paul and one of our shows nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. So you got him on your show. He'll work for anyone. Like I'm a known Logan Paul hate or I despise him and he didn't care. I mean, he's just weapon for hire. Yeah, he'll come on. You could hire him probably. If you want to do like a follow up interview with, you know, Yeah, or I could challenge Logan Paul to a fight and send a look like myself or something. There you go. So have you guys put your story together yet, or is that still in the works? You probably can't get it in the US, but it was released in the UK. That's why he released it. Why do you guys do that? What's with the BBC man? It's about an American influencer doing crimes while located in America and the people that want to watch the fucking thing can't open it. That always happens to me with the BBC. Talk to your people about that. I mean, I'm a freelance journalist. I can't talk for the BBC at all, and yeah, I would like to see it distributed more widely. But yeah, we released it, and then he shortly has released his. I mean, if you want to talk with the actual allegations themselves, the cryptos you scandal and various other financial products he has promoted have been widely covered. But one of the main allegations we wanted to ask him about was We saw evidence of an anonymous crypto account which had close links to Logan Paul's account. It was first funded by his public crypto account. Then it was funded by an account belonging to his fan club. It purchased a larger amount of this meme coin, fuck Elon. Basically, Logan Paul promoted that meme coin. But moments before he promoted it in that tweet, this wallet bought almost $160,000 worth. When the market peak 12 hours later, it's sold. It's holding it roughly $120,000 profit, crashing the price. And so I asked Logan Paul at those transactions. He didn't respond to our questions about that more specifically. But yeah, his lawyer did send a letter right after he left his boxing room. Um, yeah, I'm trying it. It's trying to come to the realization that Paul Mr. Beast and other influencers have been doing this repeatedly for a very long time with the meme coins. just like totally on the side underground, just dumping like for 120th K here and there. And it seems like Mr. Beast has been up to this same business. It's pretty incredible. I wonder at what point like actual law enforcement gets involved in this because they just keep doing it. It's becoming like a public nuisance. I mean, they're causing a lot of damage. Well, the Security and Exchange Commission has been regulating the crypto market and interactions with celebrities and the crypto market. Kim Kardashians find 1.26 million from promoting a token called Ethereum Max on Instagram. Lots of other celebrities have come under the SEC's radar, but that is probably all about to change because Trump has made it very clear that he wants to be a crypto president. He wants to get rid of Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC. He wants to potentially start a crypto federal reserve. You know, we may see the end of any meaningful regulation on this kind of stuff. But it is still, you can't do it. You can't do it. Well, you can be find it to get goes against the security exchange commissions rules. So, but if you're, but if you're, if you're offering a commodity under false pretence and then like selling it out from under, I mean, I don't, I'm not a lawyer, but it seems kind of fraughty. So you, you have to, if you're a celebrity, I mean, you have to tell you if you get, you have to tell your audience if you get paid, how much you get paid, whether you own the tokens, whether you made money on the tokens, whether they actually know something about the project, like all of that information you have to disclose, otherwise you can be fined by the SEC. Have you heard of Dinkthoi? Yes, I've heard of Dinkthoi. That was a good one too. Yes, so the thing with think-doink. So think-doink is basically, it's a meme token claiming to bridge the gap between crypto and entertainment. So if you buy a token, you then suppose the own shares of a cartoon character and earn a portion of its earnings if it appears in a TV show or film, which it never has. Logan endorsed the part two over six million of his Twitter followers in 2021. He continued to promote it along with his friends from his YouTube channel as podcast. But yeah, the effect of his promotions was encouraged fans to buy an invest tons of money pushing the price of it over 400% just four days. But what his ex-remate Jake Brido said is that he actually and a much bigger role than he claimed in the creation of Dink Dunk. You know, Logan said he was just a fan of the funny little spring character, which is his icon, but according to his experiment and friend, he said he was hanging out with Logan and they came up with it together, basically, and Logan actually designed the character on his phone on Snapchat. And Logan denies a new wrongdoing on that story as well, and claims he didn't make any money on it. Have you heard the song? Yes. You listened to it regularly or just kind of when you're invested in it. We do. Yeah, kind of catchy. Oh, don't shit this. Yeah, yeah. I want to take a picture of my face. Yeah, yeah. And he sings the song too. Right, that is bad. Hold on one sec. He's a little sick. You could probably tell if he wanted to throw it through. Oh man. So I mean we asked Logan about this and he didn't. He denied making any money from trading and taking to intelligence. He denied that he was involved in the product development other than supporting his friend Jake Broder. It's incredible. I don't know what to say because people keep buying this crap. I mean, Logan's on his fifth public rug poll. You had the dink toy. You had the crypto zoo. Then you had this one. You guys are talking about the E1 gate or the fuck. Was there another one there? It's fucking Elon and Elon gate. The same thing over those two individual rug polls that he participated in. Um, well, he would deny that those were rug pools or that he, um, rug. Then he's a lenge to have rug pools. Those are two different coins. Yeah. Oh, wow. Okay. So it's even more than I thought. You weren't involved in falling to those two. Yeah. Nice. Um, yeah. I mean, it's, it's complicated. I mean, shortly after this whole thing happened, um, Andrew Tate, who I previously investigated, and who, I'm sort of his enemy number one, he kind of wrote off the back of this to... That's that. This is what the coin will call. It's retake that. That you can't say, but it's okay. We have a button. We can dump. No, you're totally good. I didn't expect it to be that. Matt said, can I curse? I said, yeah, you could say anything. But then, and it's not your fault. You said, the F-seller for gay people, which is not what you said. It's the name of one of their coins, which is insane. Right. So you're saying the coin was called Matt Shea is an F-seller. Exactly. You may say one of the like two words we can't. Yeah, you two. They get mad. It's not your fault. It's with slurs, but you're good. You're good. We, uh, we have a broadcast dump button. So all good. No worries. I'm, I'm, I'm merely accurately reporting what the cryptocurrency is. Yes, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm merely accurately reporting what the cryptocurrency is. Yes, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm And so this coin that he essentially pumped and got his fans to pump basically. I mean, that and a bunch of other coins based on me with my face and they caught there was a coins based around the term DNG, which stands for Dark Nerd Geek, which is something that says, I do recover from that. Yo! I don't know if I can continue this call DMG. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's like there. Yeah, that's their favorite terms for me. And there are coins based around that. The total market cap for some of these coins was like $400,000 within an hour of entity talking about it to his fans. I think overall if I had to estimate it would be something around $2 million worth of trades were made in coins based around me. I'm just writing for that. I mean, you can't use your likeness for commerce. Yeah, I'm not aware, but if the rules around that, but in any case, yeah. I mean, so what do you want to weird word right now? What do you specialize in exactly? Just like going to dirt bags where they are and taking a month that seems to be a niche you've carved out. Yeah, well, I mean, these people do interest me because what I'm interested is this new kind of influencer who seems to be able to gain attention, power, and followers purely by being controversial in an auction. You know, the way that a lot of social media algorithms are set up is such that It's almost the more controversial amongst you are the more influence you get. And you have to be quite clever to translate that influence into financial gain. But yeah, I mean, it's fascinating because we often think about like how these people radicalize their audiences. But we don't often talk about it is how their audiences actually radicalize them back. So there's a, there's a kind of a, exactly. Yes. Yeah. It happens a lot. Right. And you could say that process started with Trump, with Andrew Tate, even on reality television, which is kind of a proto-social media, in the sense that it was a medium where the more controversial and outrageous you were, the more attention you got, the more the producers liked it. That's how the apprentice got ratings, that's how the show Andrew Tate was on. Big brother got ratings. And then in social media, they found a platform that could do that to an even higher degree. And yeah, essentially they were, all these people are master manipulators of that kind of, that space in between being a genuine person and just performing for an audience who are just, yeah, eager for controversy. Is there any other characters out there that you've kind of got your eye on that exist in that space? All you can say is watch this space on that. Nothing, nothing I'm at liberty to talk about. So you are working on other. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't jack dorty. I know who that is. Yeah. That's a real fucking piece of shit right there. But I mean, that's like that kid is wild. I don't know how much cloud he has left these days, but it's really interesting. Yeah, I mean, if you have any advice for turning controversy into cash, I would certainly appreciate it. I have a lot of controversy and not a lot of cash coming in. Well, you could launch an energy drink. Okay. Okay. Okay. Very good. Very good. I like it. Let me write that down. As a side note, I'd like to say matter specs for you getting in the ring with Tate. When you win in there, that must have been scary. So. Yeah, thank you. That was hilarious because I mean, it wasn't just getting in the ring with Tate because I mean, he was. He told me I could film him boxing and then he was like, put some gloves on your boxing me. And I didn't like the questions you're asking me this morning and stuff. You know, I never boxed before and whatever it was like slightly intimidating, but it was it was fine. I would think I was. I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think I would think and then annotate about how you can't just beat the crap out of a journalist because it won't be good. So he was just way, I like lost consciousness for a second, but the really crazy thing was I'd flown to Romania to investigate his war room, his kind of his elite, supposedly elite like inner network of of of alpha males it cost like thousands of dollars you paying thousands of dollars a year to to learn from and you take had to be an alpha male and all these guys have flown to Romania to be in the presence of their their lord and commander and you take and they didn't know what they're signing up for the they'd knew that they'll be performing participants of the test and uh... Basically, we all get to this hotel in the mountains in Transylvania. We're all sat down. Andrew T. comes out and he says, in three days time, each of you will be given a choice of whether to fight a professional cage fighter on live Romanian television. You can say yes or you can say no. But if you say yes, like this is a real fight, like you could die, you know, you could get very seriously injured. And yeah, he just created this test of masculinity. And if you said no, he, you know, he didn't want us to film the people who said no. But we did, we did. And they were made to sit facing the wall and like journal about how shameful they were as men. What? Yeah. And if they said, yeah, if you said yes, then yeah, you did this fight. And what's the fight? Was it actually that was it actually like, pretty rough for us? I mean, sorry, good. No, I'm sorry, go ahead. Where the people getting beat up who agreed to fight? Yeah, I mean, yeah, calling it like a fight is actually general. I mean, it's just, it's like getting, it's basically, but yeah, so before me, someone got knocked out and taken away in a stretcher. there was blood splattered across the ring. But I had a different tactic than the other dudes. So the other guys were going and they're actually trying to win the fight and throwing punches. I ran away from the guy in expanding circle, just trying to get away from him. And then when I wanted the fight to end, because I heard that most fights end on the ground, in, like, yeah, on the ground in MMA. I sort of, like, grappled him. And by that, I mean, I kind of just like slowly hugged him, kind of almost requesting him to end the fight. And then he, he threw me on the ground and then did a ground of pound finish. And I, I felt like I bruised my rib, but other than that. I got to say that you did all that shit, huh? I think Andrew's got to respect you at least a little bit for getting in the ring with him and also doing this weird f**k in f**k club's bullshit. He does. Yeah. Well, he did for a time. And then I asked him to enter my ring, if you will, and to do an interview. And then I put to him some very serious allegations, including allegations about grooming. which he denied. But yeah, he was very upset and he kicked me out of the war room. And his kind of, his head of security, Jules Sullivan, he was almost in tears. He was so upset that I had sort of betrayed their trust by asking him about it. So they thought you are one of them. They really were like fully on board. I think they thought that the experience of going through this fight would would somehow make me a question. Did it bond you to them at least a little bit? Did you feel bad at all at a certain point because you went through some heavy stuff with them? I think you always have some connection with someone you spend that much time with. I've spent a lot of time with those guys. However, I also spend a lot of time with women who accuse them of rape and of physical violence, allegations that they deny. And, you know, when you hear their stories, it's very difficult to feel if what they're saying is true, you know, admiration or of any kind for the taste for the French, you know. Wow, what an interesting experience. Well, how are we going to get back at Logan? What are we going to do to him? Well, I would just, I would just point people back to the documentary and to our reporting on it. And, yeah, I mean, I think the documentary that we produced, like contains all the allegations we wanted to make, people can watch that, they can see that, can make up their own mind. Do you recommend people use VPN or can you let's say that? I would never recommend anyone use the VPN. But how are they supposed to watch it, man? You can ask the BBC, I'll give you there, you know. Okay, good. So everybody's, yeah, there you go. That's how we're going to watch it. I notice after every time you mention it, allegation, you say, which they deny, is that that's an intentional slip of liability, right? Well, I mean, this is the thing. I mean, you know, annotated Logan Paul may may not believe this, but I endeavor to be an impartial journalist. You know, I give people the chance to respond to any allegation I make. That is why I went to Puerto Rico to interview Logan Paul. You know, I include his lawyers, you know, when they respond to the allegations, I include those in the film. I include annotates, denies, and, you know, in the film. I also include the accusations of the women who make allegations against Andrew Tay, and I included the allegations of the Logan Paul fans who feel that they were scammed or exploited by Logan Paul. So that is what reporting is, you know, and they're trying to characterize reporting and journalism itself as some kind of like personal attack. And then respond by attacking me, but that's, you know, that's, that's, that's the Trump being response to negative press. Right. But, um, well, I look forward to your next scoop. And thank you very much. I'd love to hear from you again once that drops, which women and we'll, we'll make sure that we send lots of emails to the BBC and we will not be using VPNs so watch your full story on Logan Paul. No comment. Yeah. Well, nice meeting you, man. Nice chatting. I appreciate you, Paul. Thank you. Thanks, man. I appreciate everybody. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Well, top again soon, hopefully. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. That's Matt Shea from the BBC, everybody. Hi, Matt. You're all. BBC, do you know what else that stands for? Oh, well, there's that aspect, but you don't even know about the little subplot that was going on this whole time, dude. Or I can imagine where the Thursday is super thirsty. Oh, yeah, I had a feeling he had some guy. Yeah, I know our chat is like the most fucking bastardly third thing fucking He looks exactly like a bachelorette contestant. Do you remember Peter from Rachel's season? Peter from Rachel's season? Peter from Rachel's season? I sent you a timestamp while she's pulling it up. I sent it timestamp. We can't show it, but yeah, he has balls for getting in that ring because the guy was repeatedly just hitting him in the face. We can't show it because it's vice. No, because it's violin. Oh, because it's violin. Yeah, that guy is pretty hardcore. I mean, that's definitely brave to just go in and get your ass kicked by someone. Fuck that. You know what I mean? So they were all pretty stoked like this guy's the real deal. There you go. What do we think? Yeah, I mean, he's... Dogs just like him. No. Yes. Okay, I mean, and the gap between his teeth. I see a little resemblance. I see it 100%. Anyway, yeah, our keeper caught me in Narc. Listen, listen. You got to own it, people. If you're going to be horny on men like that, you got to just own it. Yeah, I mean, there's no secret, isn't it? Yeah. There's a public chat. Yeah, people. They didn't need the Narc. I knew what you scoundrels were up to. You guys are, you guys are just desperate as hell, man. Oh, no! What did I do? What am I diagnosed with? I actually here, I was sent to, uh, I was passed a meme, a meme arena here. You're actually autistic shit. And apologies in advance to our friend, Jake. I will. I will survive. You can make a buddy. You didn't see Gladiator 2. You went and watched Wicked. He's so right. He looks like some actions stand by the way. The totally who looks like Peter from the Bachelorette. All right. I'm going to go to the bathroom and then we'll get into the Kaisenat. Okay. Story here. Okay. I'll be right. Stand. Let's talk about other people he looks like. Hold on. I think the Giggle every time. That's two Keymstar things that's made me like Giggle more than ever. Like this episode. How much does Keym really have to do with drama alert at this point? It seems like it's just kind of farmed out to some people. It's just the whole context though with it being Keymstar and then it's like Diagnosed with it. Right on Tyler. Diagnosed. Oh, that's so good. Oh, what is this one? Oh, oh, this was. What do I got? No, don't do me like that. Don't do me like that. Haternitis. With what? Haternitis. Haternitis. I just can't talk my head. I... I have checked to the Hader title at this point. I feel like I've moved on from my Hader era. Although I did say that Gladiators over the Hader era in this episode, which would be nice to take a big issue with. Gladiators such a dad movie. Such a dad movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I like that movie. I What does it got? Let's see. It's a theater story. The ultimate tale of revenge. He stayed alive for vengeance and protection. We're telling you that it's the gladiator. The gladiator is truly a servant. But he has a 64 on Metacritic with a 5.3 audience score versus wicked. Which is fantastic. Oh, not as high as I thought 73. Still better. That's a score and a user score of 8.7. Clearly, it is the superior film. Although I won't have to see myself to really make that judgment call. I'm going tonight for the second time. Really? Yeah, I am. I like it just because of how happy it makes Olivia. Thanks. That's enough. It's true. I found out my sister went to it on a preview night and she brought like 10 friends of hers that none of which are like musical theater people but she like I think she paid for their tickets and got 10 people to come with her. And they all loved it. They all loved it. I love it. I love your sister. I love your sister. And she has such great taste in musicals. We talked about rent. Right. Right. Backstage at the live show, me and your sister really, really. You actually talked to her about her. I was like, I've heard of you. You and I love the same thing. It's true. It's true. My sister is very Olivia coded or vice versa. I don't know. And I love you. All right, let me get to some of these super chats. We're getting many generous ones today. Let's see. Hi, fam. It's my 22nd birthday today. I'm feeling a little weird about it because I feel stuck where I was when I turned 21. Trying to take it easy though. Just want to thank you for always make me laugh through my bad days. Love y'all. Thank you, Tally. I mean, you feel stuck because you feel like you're in the same place that you were when you were 21. I mean, it's only been here. You were young. I remember stressing so much that age. I didn't figure out shit tells like 29. You're good. I live it up. Don't stress. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know the particulars of your situation. Maybe you have a very good reason to be stressing about that. But yeah, I wouldn't be too. Don't beat yourself up. You're 22. You got so much life ahead of you. You just always just work out honestly. You think they're not gonna, then they do just, you're working towards whatever you're working at and it will come to you. Sometimes things don't work out. Sometimes things work. It works out. It works out. It works out. It works out. My mind has always been if you're working toward something, eventually you'll get it. The second you give up is when it goes away. I still think you're saying give up and don't try because it's going to work out. No, just keep working on your craft. Just keep doing stuff and things you'll be noticed one day. I have the mic Tyson mentality. We're nothing. We're just fucking dust here. I got some motivation. All right. I mean, it runs out. Go ahead. What's the motivation? I can see it. This bag right here. Let me explain to you this bag. I had this backpack for probably seven, eight years now. And for four years, I was carrying around this camera gear and all this equipment and people thought I was a fucking idiot because they're like, why do you have that? It has nothing to do with your job. And now I use it every single day. And I was prepared and I had this stuff because I believed that one day I would achieve what I wanted, even though I was working in a medical office in one day away from being a fucking loser, but it worked out for me. Somebody does for you too? It's like, what's that? What's that? What's that? We're getting a medical office, it's just not making you a fucking loser, by the way. I know that's not what you meant, but... You said there's so many other things that you said. Uh, somebody just don't have 50 bucks. Hannah, Hannah, we know. Just the Hannah, we know. The Hannah, we know. The Hannah, we know. The one thing my boyfriend wants for his 21st birthday, which is tomorrow, on Thanksgiving. The pilgrims really trying to take that away from him. Uh, is a shout out on this podcast. This one right here. Can you please say Happy Birthday Miles Bartholomew Gale? Damn. Wow. What a shame. You dropped that whole government name. Yeah. Miles Bartholomew Gale. Ready? One, two, three. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Miles Bartholomew Gale. Gale. Shut up. I hope you enjoyed that. Hope you enjoyed that. He also requested that Zach plays the 21 sound during the shout-out. Oh no! We fucked up. We did it again. I bet he would want that. We're still in the shout-out. You can still do it. This is still part of the shout-out. Okay. Hit him. Hit him. I bet he would. Oh, you're not. You're denying? 21. Fuck you. Okay. That's nice. What is up? My mouse is moving. Is there a little puppy down there? That is moving on my mind? I have something I want to talk about. Yes, there is. Something important. As crossed by mind. Did it hit you in the bathroom? That's from the. No, not quite in the bathroom. And the kitchen. What the fuck is this? This golden, they called a golden Oreo. Oh, I was going to put it on top of my dish. Do you understand how racist this is? Why? It's like just, it's white washed. It's white. Fucking cookies, appropriating black culture, black cookies. The golden black cookie. I mean, the Oreo is delicious. And this is worse. That is true. The semi-emoryos are not as good as the classic Oreos 100. It looks like with the on that. It's just more, you know. Yeah, the normal Oreos were here first. I'm saying we don't need a white version of Oreo. That's why I was going to put it on my disgusting dish. But I ended up not eating it just because it didn't work. But that's why I got the other ones. I think that's a bad choice. This is Oreo appropriation. I know it's horrible. I thought we moved fast to that by now. I see. Not a lot not a lot to last for them, but that's okay You know, it was not the dog it was fresh. It may be a little time longer to cook They're really not on angle there. You went for it. Look they're good but like the original Oreos untouchable. It's $7 bag and that's still expensive, but then you also have to factor in that the bags aren't even big to begin with. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's $4,000. It's Yeah. It's just ridiculous at this point. Pull to be a soundbite, I suppose. What was the cookie thing? The thing that you, your revelation? You said you want to talk to it? Talk about it. That was a kind of love. Alright, let's get to our main story. Somebody in the chat said all the silly flavored Oreos are trying to hard couldn't agree more. Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more? Can I read more I could do that. That's actually pretty simple to set up. If you wanted to, like, get off the thing that'd be good. It's like, I'm always coughing in half. You could set them up with companion. Zach. Oh, yeah. Just like a hold to mute. Yeah. Instead of a toggle. So it's just mute 20 holes on the button. And with all due respect, this microphone with your illness right now is not ideal. Well, yeah, get, you know, I'm aware, let's get the, let's get another button on this desk. Okay, let's do it. Second button. Second button. That's the mask. Kentucky. That he's in his punk mode again. He's scratching his feet on the floor a little bit. It's like a ball. Someone to play with them. Oh, Chass it in mute foot pedal. That's also a thing you can ask. It's kind of cool. Yeah, they have those, uh, Elgado has those. I don't need a foot pedal. You prefer. Okay. Okay. Oh, God. All right. Let's see what Kai's in at. Yeah, let's let's talk about this shit because this is wild. Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai, Kai is currently in the midst of a 30 day long Subathon. 24-7 stream. His second Mafia thong, they calling it. I don't know why. Why they call them Mafia thong? Because his fans are his Mafia. The way we have the history family, basically. It's like the nickname for his fan base. The Mafia. Yeah. Yeah, they got a cool. It's another type of family. It's kind of... It's like army. It's like, right, exactly. Or yeah, the Fupa Trooper army or whatever. And for his announcement post he had Kim Kardashian in his little ad for a pretty cool. You got Kevin? Yeah, Kim Kardashian. He is basically as big as it gets now. Like it is genuinely mind blowing his level of love. He's so in with like a musical label because they are sending all their like top artists on his stream to promote their shit. And it's like Kim's kids are obsessed with kisenat. So like a bunch of like huge huge like celebrities. Because they're children. Definitely got something to do with it. He did a commercial for the sub-ethan with yeah. What the fuck? It's so cool. And it's really real commercial for what? No, for his. Yeah. That the kid's for his. You know, you shouldn't be reading that stuff. No, no, no. And the operation is insane. Dude, it happened. It's in if and no. I think his heart has like probably 50 camera set up. Okay. Yeah, I mean, streams from this mansion and we'll see a bit of it in what we're going to be watching today because it was very dynamic and it was like moving around the house, moving into the backyard into his main streaming room. And it's, yeah, I see him. And he's going for it. Also, they have like the whole soprano set recreation for that. Right. Yeah. And he was getting swallowed last week and he's like, I hear helicopters outside. He tells us which people, do we have a camera on that? Immediately. There's a camera on the roof showing the helicopter. It's like next fucking level. Yeah, he's obviously super talented, but he has an amazing team too. Whoever's like promoting him, managing him. Absolutely. That's what he's doing. The tech, like it's a pretty good. Although after this, There might be some people that he needs to have a talk with. I guess well, it remains to be seen how coordinated this entire incident was. Ducky. Ducky, here, let me, I can play with him. I can't even say no because I feel back because he's bored. Ducky, this is my tissue I need this. Yeah. It's kind of funny though. Ducky, here, don't play with the tissue, okay? Don't play with it, okay? Don't do it. We need to get scared. I'll get tissue delivery. I just still use it. Look at all this. This is premium tissue, man. It is good stuff. Please. All right, so let me wash this ad. It seems like you've been really busy since the last time I saw you. Yeah, it's no claim. We didn't test it, so maybe we should, you might get caught. But what is that? Oh, okay, that's where it's. Adter, yes. Okay, but you're on with you. It sucks. Okay, he got him in the, that's obviously super high level production. Last night he had a magician on another YouTube or named Max Major. That name's trouble. Max had previously collabed with Kai on a stream last year. Maybe they got over 5 million views. Let's take a look at that. Kai's snack gets hypnotized. I'm still, I've got one hypnotist to come in here and try to hypnotize us. Well, this is probably available because like I'm I'm a hater. I'm not an unbeliever, but I'll like I'll let them try. Well, hold on. You don't know what you're saying because what you're saying exactly is why this whole scandal that we're about to talk about happened because basically as you'll probably see a little bit in this video is he was invited to collab with Kai and come on a stream and everything and they were hating. They were hating a little bit. They were pushing back on him. and this. Yeah. Kai gets hypnotized. Stop! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What the f*** was that, bro? I got invited to Kai's house to perform for the largest audience in Twitch history, which is a lot of pressure. A lot. I mean, not necessarily watching the day you were there, but a lot. And I'm hoping to pull off some like craziest mind tricks, including hacking in the Kai cell phone, hypnotizing his friends and attempting my most guys big enough. He needs to be getting like David Blaine, you know what I mean? Like fuck these like dollar store, magician, YouTube, magicians. I know. It's going on, man. We're here. What's up, man? Kai? Matt. Very nice to meet you, man. Congratulations. This is amazing. This is amazing. This is amazing. Should we get into it? Let's have fun. Yeah, that's a fun. So some people, they call me like, yeah, you can grab a chair if you want. Mindhacker. Some people call me a magician. Some people call me a hypnotist. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindhacker. Some people call me a mindh It's just to to play with your minds. That's what we're going to do. We're going to get inside your heads a little bit. So we're going to warm up. It's going to get me warm up. We're going to get you guys warmed up. And then we're going to do some crazy stuff. All right, cool. Kai, I'm going to start with you that I'll help me calibrate a little bit. Okay. All right. Help me calibrate. I'm going to write, uh, let me just see the first trick here. Then we'll see what happens. Sure, yeah. A little secret note to you. Okay. It's something that I think if I show it to you in a minute, it's going to mean something to you, but you can kind of be the judge of this. What's your name? Punga. All right, you're going to be my witness. Okay, camera can't see this, but you're going to see, okay, what's going on here? You follow me? No, don't say it out loud. Don't say it out loud, okay? Kai, what month were you born? I was born in December. December, baby. Okay. Yeah, I think this will work. Yeah, can you hold my pants so I can't change my mind? Kai, this is my warm-up. Look at me. I want you to name any two-digit number out loud. A number from 10 to 100. What pops into your head? Be random. Not your birthday. 99. Where did that come from? Why? Because I'm not that old one. It's okay. 99 over. It's okay. He's like... What the fuck? Kai will say 99. He's gone. We already lost one. Oh my god! You comment how sloppy the signs were. So you know why because he writes it with his thumb. I know that trick. There's a really you have like ink or like a piece of pencil on the tip of your thumb and you they give you the answer and after they tell you the answer you write it So this is why this right here is why I'm worried about bringing somebody like this on the show because he'll just immediately be calling out. Oh, that's not a serious truth. He's he's claiming he showed his friend that it said Kai will say no, I do not before he said it. All right. I mean, was that I think there he's relying on us thinking that, but maybe he didn't actually write the number. That will be written. Kai said this number like that's that's nothing. Yeah, I guess that's true. So maybe not. Anyways. Oh, he's gone. There is a good start. That's a good start. Do my favorite. Can somebody run out in the living room? There's like some books magazine. Like that on the the living room table. Can somebody run out just off the coffee table? Just grab a stack of books or magazines. Like that like that like that. So yeah, and this video was an amazingly for him. It has over 5 million views on YouTube. It was on his highest rate of video by far. This guy's name is Max. Max major. Max major. Let me check his channel out. He's curious what he's up to. He's got one million subbies. Stop there! Oh, he even has a kiss in that video from a day ago. Right, well, so that's a spoiler alert for this story. I'm not going to watch that yet. So that's them. He came on his stream this time. to set up a hanging, their double trick that went quote wrong. No, what I think happened is he said I'm gonna do like an escape artist thing. Yes, where I hate. And then I escape safe. Like he makes it. It's a little bit, I gotta explain it. It's a little bit more complicated than that. So basically he attached himself, put a new surround his neck and got up on a platform. and had several ropes attached to a pulley that Kai was in control of. And he was saying, I'm so psychic that I know that you'll pull the right rope, that I'll be okay, so that I won't be home. And then I don't know if you want to explain it, but basically that didn't go that way. But let me watch it. I don't think I can show it, but I'm going to. Not the moment you could potentially show the lead up to it, but I can still tell you when to take it off then. I mean, he is standing there with the rope around his neck. Just tell me when to get off before it happens. Well, even I'm just, okay. No, that's all right. No audio. I'll believe in that. Yes, let him do, he can't do it anyway. There he is. So there he is, that's the guy. That's Max. You see the cone in front of Kai is like the contraption. You see those handles. There's a yellow one in a red one. So this again is supposed to be some sort of like He's a mind hack. Like he said, he hacked. He knows which one. Kai will pick and therefore he'll be safe. Nothing will happen. Oh, I want to see these. I don't look at sugar. And I see people in the chat panicking. Let me just, I guess this is a spoiler alert. He's completely fine. The guy is fine. Yeah, yeah. No one gets hurt in this. He's pranking Kai. He's pranking Kai. I think he's making Kai think that he likes X and inadvertently killed him. Which is Diabolical. Which is Diabolical. I insane. So, oh, thank you, Nate, that's a good idea. Yeah, there's no death. There's no harm, nobody's hurt. You would see, guys, Chad is like not, not really loving this. Because the baby is right now. People are like, you know what that girl fuck in this. Kids watching him, this is such a crazy thing. So, if I give a big count down, so you know, it's happening shortly, so maybe you should just, yeah. Yes, he's almost 600,000. That's pink. That's pink subscribers. And 600,000? Yes, sir. What is 600,000 times 3.75? A lot of money. I'll look it up. Let's see, five, eight, zero, seven, one, zero, times three, point five. All right. We point seven, five is what he gets probably. Yeah. It's a little over two million dollars. I'm on the middle of love. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. I mean, they spend a lot of money on their production. For sure. For sure. That's a lot of support. Well, I'm curious if he's getting paid by the artist. It's possible, at a certain point, it definitely becomes an option. Right, probably. Probably. Probably. Yeah, it could be. Could pay for that. And? Oh, shit. Non! Wait! Hey! I'm never gonna blow it. So you're not showing it. Yeah, go cut the way down. Three, two, one. So I'll lift some up. Okay, everyone starts panicking. The fact that it... That was fake is shit. You can cut back now because it never comes back. So what happened was he pushed the button first of all it lifted him up. Why would it lift him up that it make any sense. Right. And I pretty sure the friction wasn't on the rope. There was a second connection. Yeah. Big is what is wrong. He's wearing a harness. Yeah. If you look closely, you can find us here. And then it immediately drops him. So I don't think he was even hanging for even a split second. I'm gonna go back. It didn't really even look that. It looked like a, okay, let me watch that again. You can't really, oh, Jesus is streaming as long as you can. Yeah, this is, this is the vaude of the stream. So it's like 24 hours long. Okay, wait, you probably. I click your back. It's time to see it. You shouldn't have done that. Well, just let me know. Let's click the time to sample you. It doesn't. Give me a minute. So here he is setting it up. Let's see, let's try that again. I want to see that again. Because to me it looks like pretty obviously fake, not that scary. I'm not gonna, I feel like I could show you guys because it's so obviously fake. But I'm not going to, yep, for that reason. It's just not worth the risk. I believe in Max. So is there a way to skeep forward with that? I'm just guessing. All right, eh? But yeah, I don't, don't skip around. Oh, we'll never be able to find the same spot. I tell you, here we go. Okay, take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. Take a bite. I can't do this shit. The speed that the best machine came on the most. 10. Nine. What? Eight. I'm never on blood. What are you talking about? Three. Two. One. The rope is like not even hot. And then it immediately dropped. And then the medics come on immediately. What's the danger? Even if he was hanging it dropped him and like fight like a split second? Well, if it were real, his neck could have broken instantly. But he went up. He didn't like drop. Yeah, it's obvious. It's fake. I mean, yeah. We're a bit like if this. But in that moment. You were like, oh my god, this is real. Oh my god. And everybody, everybody, everybody, all of his team are in on it. So they all immediately reacted in a panic. They had the medic run over there and let me hear reading him. Good. I was out there. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I need you to check out. I Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't leave. You're not yours. I gotta make sure he's gone. I'm sorry, Hitler. I'm sorry, Hitler. But do not try this at home. What's that? We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't do this. We because he thinks he just maybe killed somebody live on stream so he is rightfully Pretty concerned right now or he realized or he probably has some suspicion that that was a he might but he want yeah, he wants to know like the guys okay Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're gonna report back let's report back. I'm sorry Or there's a lot more to this. Okay, okay, right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. So they take them out of the area. Okay. They send what check back in. Do anything more to watch at this part. No, I mean, not really. You could skip ahead. Okay. But yeah, I mean, it's just a lot of add a lot of panicking a lot of like what the fuck is going on. Sure. Yeah. To me, it sounded like they didn't believe it was real. Yeah, and it didn't look real if I'm being honest. It just looked weird. So here is Max, does a reveal on his YouTube channel. How soon after that? If you're watching this, that means that... How soon after did he do this? Release this video. Probably like 15 minutes later. So he sent it to Kai. Actually, I have to, you know, send it to Kai reacting to it. One second. reacting to this clip, I mean, so let me watch that then. Yeah, it's right here. I don't feel like shit. I feel like do these in shit. I feel like turds. I feel like diarrhea in turds. I got tea right here. Thank you. But when you don't know, that was all according to my plan. See, at the start of my performance, I said that tonight was all about choices. But not just the choices that you made tonight. The choices that you've made since the day that we met. What's with today? What? He took empathy when we met. I'm going to pull him up. Well, I don't think it's a catch in the game last. I think it's not behind him. He's like a star. He's going to be like a happy energy. I know, I'm off course with Lex. I'm on a test. No! I have the little hole I'm just going to pull through his lips. I'm going to talk about what I'm going to try to do. So we've got to ask him to create it. He's really trying to prove you well. We've all been so glad he had that right now. That's it. You want to see me fail. I thought tonight I could be exactly what you asked for. I thought the game was to make the right choice. I plan to influence you to make the wrong choice and I knew you'd pick the red hand. But no, he's there. Before you. Oh, there's no evidence that the green handle would have saved them. No, Kai actually, I think it's outside the scope of this clip, but when I watched the full bod, he pretty quickly identified. He went and found the video and he's like, he uploaded two versions with both handles, unlisted and they made it public. He figured it out. Wait, how did he find that out? Huh? How did he find that? He was just speculating, but I think he's right. They made two versions, one with each handle and depending on what he picked, they uploaded that video. Interesting, okay. Yeah. Oh my god, he's a big Korean. He didn't want to feel like you're playing a game of chance. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. You have to remember when you're playing a game. I think what he did is so fucking weird. Like, so over the top and out of pocket. I think it could have worked if the reveal was better. Because this is like typical mentalist bullshit. Yeah. I was influencing you from the first day. So he felt bullied by Kai and his friends. That's what he did to this. He kind of felt that way, right? And that didn't fail. It's like they shut up. And like Drake. He felt like the clip of them pushing him. It's like he's he want. That's how the way I'll get back to you is making you think you murdered me. Alright. Imagine if our boy David, the poker magician, if he came in and was like, I'm going to do a magic trick for you Ethan. Here take this gun, I'm going to catch this bullet in my mouth. And then you shot it at him and he had a blood pack go off on the back of his head and we thought we'd just shot him in the fucking face. good content. I don't know, yeah, I think he would be pretty upset. And he didn't tell us that that was the plan at all. This content is pretty hype. Like I've seen a lot of people giving a talking about Kai. Nothing he needs it, but like I think a lot of people are too did it in. Because of this, you mean? I love you. I mean, I guess, but I mean, a lot of people are now saying that he should be banned because we're getting to that. Yeah. Yeah. That for that reason, we haven't got there yet. Oh, that's it. OK. So that's that. There's more. A lot more. Um, XQC. Uh, people reacting to it. XQC on kicks as he should be banned. What? Why would XQC have such a dumb take? He's talking about the suicide part or the kidnapping part. I think it's all kind of part of it. Why don't we tell the whole story? I shouldn't have put the reactions here. So let me skip ahead and do. So Kai's security manages to get their hands on one of Max the magician's producers and bring them upstairs to explain what happened, which is interesting. I'm surprised that he was hanging around long enough for that. They should have Yeah, and I guess what I should explain is for a while after all of this, both Kai and his team were repeatedly trying to reach Max. And he just went, he just started ghosting them. He didn't respond at all. Disappeared like a wonderful magician. Like an Elvis on a date disappeared. Yeah, just like my wife. I see. So, there's like a whole army. Yeah, I think a lynch mob. Look at this. They're gonna fucking kill us. This is like that scene from me. We're gonna be east. We're gonna go into the castle to kill him. I think it's Atlanta. I think it's Atlanta, but let me double check. Oh, in Atlanta. I'm not going to LA right now. Oh, this is LA. Oh, shit. Yes. There's normal mansions in Atlanta. So yeah, so this is where he's getting shit. Oh, wait. What the fuck? Look how they're carrying it. That's a little sketch. That's what I'm saying. So this is what the people that are saying he should band or honing in on this. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. He probably would've come in on his own without being, you could just intimidate him without actually touching him. Yeah, the physically putting their hands on him is, uh, that's a back call. It should not have done that. Oh. Yep. I should have done that. Which, and I'll say, Kai realizes that pretty shortly after this. He doesn't see it. He doesn't see it. He doesn't see it. Oh, he says he can't leave at some point. Yeah. No, he was like, you don't want to bring him up. This guy's a prisoner So this is, this is Max's right hand man, apparently. So I could tell in the clip he was like, he was the guy leading up the, yeah. This, I'm going to annoy everyone. This feels staged to me. I just got to speak in mind that this part feels staged to me. I don't think the other stuff seems staged, but this part feels weird to me. I would that other part. Would they not be stage of this? Well, it makes so little sense. Why would they not stage the main part and then stage this part? I know, but I'm just, I'm just, I mean, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't really make sense, but I'm saying the way they're acting and they were they're talking to each other seems stage to me. I don't know what that means, right? Okay. Just hedging, you always hedging. Always hedging. Yeah. Okay. Just in case. That's, that's, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that What's it cut off there? Because that's where they cut it. Well, there's the next clip has part of their conversation. I'm going to see what happens now. Hit no. I'm just saying that because in my opinion, that throws all into question to me. It's, I'm a little bit curious. What about that? That's interesting. I haven't watched this whole interaction here. Chat agrees with you. Some of them think that it looks staged. Which number am I on? I'm confused. Six is what we just watched because it looks like you just changed everything. Number seven. Okay, why just what these one minute cliffs to show me what happens? The fuck is this website? You laughing too, I see you laughing. Look, just calling back, cause it's not a joke, how did I call him? Okay, also he's not, okay, you can't leave until you know, cause you're his right hand man, correct? You was coming in and out of the room, I told you to. You said this whole shit up with him, okay? Just please, I'm asking you from human to human. I gave you a chance last year to come back. and I watched y'all back and I felt like he can't show me respect enough to come back to the house and explain to the people what happened is fucked up I feel like from humans a human I understand and if you don't buy that fucked up and you don't have like and you have like you don't know what's going on you will fuck up individual I'm dead ass gang I'm not trying to fuck with you I'm dead ass I'm trying to fuck with you I'm just like what it is and that's crazy you know you know I was weird right just look me my face and say I can't come on camera you look me my face said I'll stay it's beyond forever you just drag me up here I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're saying. What? I hate these one minute clips. The shit is lame as fuck. I want to watch the interaction. That's just the way that clips on Twitch work. It's a different website, isn't it? It's backed up to which clips. Yeah, it's backed up, yeah. Uh, Kai calmed down, told us crew to let it go. Uh, here. Now we got Twitter clips, baby. Good all fucking. One minute, exactly. Anywhere, Fimo? Now, I'm going. Now, that I'm going. He want to make us look like black people that I look crazy. I don't think he's going. He looks like fall. Call the door, bro. Call the door. It ain't worth it, bro. Us screaming at him we just look like a whole bunch of black niggas that let's look crazy so Let's just let guy handle that bro Max You fucked up Max you fucked up bro, and I'm a lot smarter now was a few years ago. I would have this I'm a lot smarter you fucked up Hey, what about leave me come that was a viral moment I guess, one hand, I feel like, it doesn't strike me as fake personally. I know that zero percent. I would say zero, but then strike me as... I mean, I watch the whole thing. I'm telling you, they were very upset. Or Kai is an incredible actor. Which, maybe I guess. Maybe one percent. I guess I don't really understand why he's so mad. Like, they got some content. Yeah, it was fucked up. Well, he's got to have the internet calling from to be banned for showing this to his audience. and it was done without his knowledge. I think he's very, he gets the vibe of the upset. And it's just such a waste of a potential strike, but it was something that he didn't do. You want to keep those in the back pocket. Record also shows, dude, he's not that controversial. Most of his streams are very violent. True, true. That's true. And like, suicide is not the best way out. Compared to his fellow Twitch streamers, dude's not doing a lot bad stuff. So here is apparently back. Max just takes my team saying. Reach his back out. It's me. Okay. Wait. Wait guys, take my listen. Max just takes my, please, it's an up check. Max just takes my team saying, it's Max, I don't have my phone. I think we have, I think we have everyone leave and we let the story be what, I think we let everybody leave and we let the story be what it is. I'm the bad guy, but coming back, it doesn't change anything. He said, come back and he doesn't change anything really. He's girl, man. I come back. What a bad man. I know. He should come back and deal with it. I feel like they could work it out. I mean, what does he think? Max, Max being a baby. These mentalists are supposed to be like, you know, will of iron. Get him to come back and face the gang. Who are all these people by the way? His friends are these creators. That's sexy red on the left. She's a famous rapper. Yeah. That's the, I heard it. I only know her from the Kendrick does. Yeah. When you dance with sexy red, I see two Babbage. Yeah. I know it. Eight in Ross was in one of her music videos. What? Yeah. And it was like, I forget what the line was. Maybe Nate knows her. Yeah. But something about like. guys be beating it to me or something for the first time and it was like eight in pretending to beat his meat to her. So she was also on the side of the creator album. She's on sticky. Oh, I know. Anyway, looking at the reactions, let's see. I'm sorry as XQC is showing out a little bit over this because he seems to be like more like, you know, living that live type of mentality. Um, live and let die. Uh, here he is reacting to this from kick. He's saying he's saying he's a skit, but brother. You understand it. That there's a major rule that's I think is important as well in on twitch and on other websites where it's like if you do like a fake swadding in the band. I'm saying if you'd fake, I'm saying they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say they'd say We should probably ban him, but honestly nobody cares. He's in this sub-ethan. The sponsors don't care. Nobody cares. We're not going to do anything. Well, this happened last in 24 hours ago. This was last night. So I guess it remains to be seen. And it probably would be a PR nightmare for them if they were to ban their biggest content creator in the middle of his giant. Hi, budget event. Also, I don't know. So maybe they'll ban him once he goes off the air in a couple of days. Yeah, could be. I mean, they're cool with like, tear it like running hoothy propaganda. Yeah, that's worse. The sound's number two right now on Twitch right behind Kai. Number two. Yeah. He's the number two biggest. Yeah. By what metric subscriptions subscriptions. How many subs do you have? I think it's like 90k or something. Yes, 90,000? It's election season. That's true, man. It's awesome, dude. There's a ton of money in propping up terrorism. To try some time. It's a huge dollar. I'm thinking about it. I'm looking to get on that IDF payroll. Um, fuck yeah, yeah, good for you man. There's a lot of money in terrorism though. You look at Qatar, you look at Saudi Arabia. I don't know if Saudi Arabia, but has below you wrong, there's a big fucking dollar in terrorism. So good for him, man. That's the socialist dream right there. Happy for him. Okay, that was interesting. I think, I mean, actually, he didn't come down that hard on him. He did definitely miss you. Who else? We got Jack Dordy. He have to do with this. When I said the Kai, he's like pretty uncontroversial. People pointed out in the shot he did have Chris Brown on his stream the other day and I didn't think that was really weird and lose our behavior this why like why do you need to do that you're on the top of the world you're doing so good why why why do I wonder if he got paid I mean maybe it's still but that's the only way anyone would have him on I feel like still possible yeah Jack Dordy. What was the plan here? Shut up, bitch. Wow. Prank or not, the guy still had a rope around his neck, which is just crazy that guy's team wouldn't even approve. Why are you talking? Like, I don't want to hear anything from you, dude. Little bro. There's no magic or prank that involves a rope around someone's neck. That's just a line you don't cross. Well, that's so hot. If there was justice, I'm not gonna complete my sentence. But I don't like Jack's already. I'll use that Jack baby. Got the fuck up Jack's already. Ditch made. Are you literally, like, almost killed your friend and then made him record your blog? Yeah. With, like, traumatic head damage. And almost killed his girlfriend? True, big up. Such a stand-up guy. All right, so that's that. I mean, it's interesting. I love the opinion that let me think what's my opinion on this. I think carefully. Yeah, I think they probably should have known that the hanging thing probably wasn't a good idea to begin with. I pointed out before the show two and this listen. There's already enough here, baseline of like that was a crazy thing to do. There is a weird extra element here of doing a hanging prank for a bunch of black people that I just thought was like, that's just a little extra spice on top. Like why did you do that? Like to the max guy? I mean, it didn't occur to them. I hadn't thought about that. It's just a little It feels a little tone down. I mean, the whole thing is tone deaf. It's why I'm saying, like, this is a, but this is the icing on top. More than the central issue, but it was a nice team to say, and we're not doing a hanging prank. Yeah, fair enough, fair enough. But it just, I don't know. I couldn't help, but I couldn't help but observe that that just felt extra weird of all of the things you could do here. I'm sure they trusted him, but at the same time, the actual malfunction that they showed didn't really seem that bad. It looks like pretty obviously fake and not that extreme. And I guess I just don't think it's a big deal. I mean, besides the race aspect, just like when you think of controversial stuff like on YouTube, you know, most people think of like the Logan Paul thing. I know it's not exactly the same, but again, I would just stay away from any hanging yeah. I saw. I know that we love Mike around here, but he don't you dare. He tweeted something. I want it. I wasn't sure how to feel about it to be honest. Send me Mike's tweet. I really like this. We got a Twitter thing right there. Mike is like in permanent pur uh purgatory and then we're always big Mike Maylack oh no that was fucked up Mike it's not like that bro why okay hold on yeah and it's like this is like bro you're literally just running deep for your dumb friend who what he did was obviously objectively unmeasurably what Yeah, like a real hanging, not not not a magician. A natural dead person. Yeah. And on purpose can consciously not on a live. It's like there's so many layers worse on Logan's part. So many layers. Can you argue though that he's making fun of Logan? Because Logan hates when it's even brought up. That's a little trolley towards Logan too, which is also why I wasn't sure how. He's trying to let he's by equating these two things. He's trying to soften what Logan did. Yeah, he's still running me. That's what he does. I mean, he's like, oh yeah, well, Kai did a prank where somebody pretended we got hanged. So what's the big difference? Yeah, big mind. I'm not really granting him. I'm, I'm race. I want to be to Mike what he is to Logan. I just want to always run deeper. No matter what. Now I'm with you Ethan. I feel like he's doing it the point now like look, Kai did it. And then he's getting as upset like when Logan did it. Right. Yep. Although, I don't doubt Kai was even made a comment on that because it was so long ago that he's like a young dude. I should write. It's probably like 13 when that happens. Yeah, probably. It's so different. It's a no shot. It's completely different. He's definitely making everyone look in. I'm saying it's at a pocket. That's my take on it. But it's also not a big deal either. Okay, what is your deal? Why are you doing everything? You really that forward? Watch this, he freaks out when I do this sound. It gets him all crazy like he wants to play when I do that. I don't know why. He just knows that's the play sound. I'm almost done, Docs. You said you had to go for today. It is 355. Yeah, because I've been getting home late. No, I want to be with my family. You know, but let me have with five minutes left. We've got You know, I thank our floor at Galacias that just donated 50 memberships. So the freakin' spot. We want to read some downies.

We can also have Mike and I again. Okay. Well, how'd you post that out so quick? I was wearing it under my shirt. You always wear such a shirt. Okay, if you love Mike so much, why don't you marry him? Oh. You like that way. Curtis said Ethan Shush. I'm trying to work. Please shut up for a minute. Okay, I'll okay. Quiet down over there.

We bring back all the fuck. Think about it. He's the type of guy who gets horny when he takes a shit. Jitting is a little bit gay. I don't have chat remembers properly.

It's definitely tilting no Because something happened you guys and you remember you remember Anyways, I'm just gonna move on from the name of stuff. Yeah. Thank you for your donation though. Stinge Vaughn Megan. Said so this is the moment Ethan's gonna listen to chat. I have no idea what you're talking about. This was sent at one 10 p.m. So fancy chef, I believe. Oh, fancy chef. Ah, true. I always listen to you guys. The chat overall, it did seem they seem to turn against fancy. I'm sorry for answering. He answered me yet. I did give him the offer. No answer. Mm-hmm. Which is weird for him. Well, that could be part of a tactic, too. He's probably cooking right now. He's busy. Literally cooking. Oh, that's true. Yeah, literally cooking. It's, it's giving tomorrow. I've, you know, to take calls in the kitchen. So that's bullshit. Yeah. Okay. He literally took calls during his podcast with, um, where they called Tom. Exactly. That's right. Well, cooking is a lot of a kind. Oh, I love it. He really is. Larissa, Larissa. And he slides it off. Coal, Larissa, not Clarissa. But not everyone. Nice. Sick reference, bro. Vanderpump rules rebooting with all new cast, Ethan A. B. Thoughts. Is that happening or you're asking if I would like that? It is happening all the cast, like, proud of post yesterday about it. I think it's a better place. They're being replaced? Yeah. They're upset. They're all of them are being replaced. What's her name? What was the girl that Schwartz was talking to? Joe? She did all with? Not the girl he cheated on with, just the girl that lived with him after he was single. I think it was Joe, but she was tweeting out, like, that she wants to be on the show now. You know what? I don't know if it's going to be good because it really depends on the people and the situations, but I think those guys are washed up. I think it's time to take them out. But the thing when it started was they were a bunch of young people in LA working on a restaurant that was awesome and now they're all like mega celebrities. It's not the same thing. They're celebrities and now they're all like super careful about their image and how they look on the show. It's time to get rid of them. Yeah. What sounds like Lisa Vanderpump agreed because I'm seeing the article now, they scrapped the entire cast for season 12. Wow. Wow. That's hardcore. Of close knit servers. That's awesome. Yeah. People are making it. I tried to get it. Tom Schwartz. I tried to be your friend. I said we can be friends for friends for Instagram. You never responded. You never reached out. I did the stand thing. I wrote you a letter. And you never reached out. So now I'm advocating now we need to start over. We need a new shorts. People were clowning on sand of all because the last thing he said in the last episode was Ariana leaving was good for him like it meant that the show could go on where he didn't have like bitch. Yeah, where he didn't have to leave basic. Oh, he's going to be gutted. That's all he has. He's such a fucking publicity bit oh and they just closed their second restaurant I saw that man those guys can't get anything right these dudes had like a Golden platter how do you fuck up a restaurant that is like on this massively successful show and you still can't make it like you cheat on one of the cast members you know right when you're about to launch the restaurant one of the beloved cast members I'm surprised like I feel like that would also just give probably this is the I'm surprised I don't think that would matter. I don't think that would matter. I don't think that would matter that much. Well, look at David Dobrik. Like he's out here having a pizza room. Yeah, I'm being in the biggest douchebag in the world. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I feel like controversial. Just bring people out. I'll watch it. I don't know if it'll be good, though. I mean, I really don't. It seems like that was kind of a lightning in the bottle with all the crew and the situations. But who knows, maybe the other stuff. They sort of tried a transition into new characters during one season. I hated it. And then I think all of them I'm not going to say all the majority of them all had like racist past or something. I've got fired literally immediately. Yeah, that's fucking go right now, dude. Well, that's why Jack's got fired, right? And, and, uh, cath. Chris, uh, Chris. They both have like racist shit. They got, but I think they falsely, uh, accused someone of doing something. I don't know all the details. That sounds pretty interesting. Um, let me burn through a couple more, uh, these generous donos, Benny, uh, the dendro file, uh, the love trees. Is that dendro? Dendro file? Dendro file? You want some fucking teeth? Hopefully it's not that you fuck-free, he's man. You know, oh shit. That's sex in the tree up. And there you go. Anyways, Friday's my birthday same as how he's. I'm turning 43. Oh, it's how he's birthday. I'm Friday. And finally catching up to Ethan once again. He may win the race, but I to flew that seat and then it's literally just gibberish and random letters. Zach, I know how you feel about birthdays, but can I get a happy 43 birthday? With peace and love, I don't know if we went all the way up into the 40s. You can try and cook something. You can combine a couple. You said you said 43? 43, yeah. Four. Three. Fuck you. I see, you were smart and had a whole contingency. Don't feed me gluten, said, please tell Ian that Jordan said happy Thanksgiving, bestie. What's up? Jordan said happy Thanksgiving. I was told to pass that message to you. They paid $20 to which you happy Thanksgiving. They called you best. Thank you. That's very kind. Oh, thank you, AV. I'm editing over here. Sorry, guys. I wasn't working on something. No worries. No worries. Quinn said, I'm late to the show today, but my husband is a private chef or the win family. Blake. and we'll cook you a beautiful meal for y'all for free. I tried super chatting last episode during the segment, but it faded away. Oh, I'm sorry, I missed that. Well, thank you. That's very generous. Ethan, do you hear? Uh, something about Lake Liz. Jeff.

I'm sure your husband is a, I mean, if he's a private chef for the win, the jury's amazing. jury's amazing. Um, okay, let me see if there's any more big boys and you got to go.

A lot of people think it may have been from alcoholism. from what alcoholism. Dimension? Yeah, apparently that can be caused by a fake product alcohol. And what is the risk of it? Yeah, really. But she's pretty young for like, yeah, now. That's honestly, what is sad and what was that? Now, whole saga, we have had so much enjoyment from her over the years. It is, I wish her and her family well. We love Dan. Although if I was method man, I would be wishing her and her family the worst. Met the man. Isn't he the one who she outed his wife is having cancer? Was it a man? Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was met the man. Damn. Well, I love met the man too. So I'm torn. Torn on this one.

For some reason, the scale never really comes across in photos of movies and stuff. When you're standing there, you're like, holy fuck, this is like a huge animal. Yeah.

We're not doing confetti. Champagne. Maybe champagne. There's not going to be any confetti. Why the fuck not? Like can we have it on Eddie?

There's a lot of ties to that, a lot of teas to cross, especially on a story as important as we're covering today. I want to make sure we get our facts straight. Also been trying to install a bidet to support my asshole. Thank you, too, by the way, our sponsor. This is no coincidence. Hello, Tashi. I was hoping to give you guys a live demonstration, but that's a work in progress, so. We'll see if we can bring that to you. Obviously, no behold, just my face. That would not be safe for you, too. But at any rate, thank you guys for being here. Nice to see you today. We've got Essentially, so this Ava Chris Tyson story is now. Become, Cody calls that home like, oh, hoof. He's like, thank God for Ava Chris Tyson. He's like, oh, I only get a break. Now we remember. I still got my eyes on you, buddy. But this is the new thing that everybody's talking about. In fact, on Monday, at the very end of the show, everyone was telling us to look into it, but it was too new and I didn't have enough information to comment on it, but we've done a thorough analysis of it and I will try my best to bring you a true and accurate reporting and obviously the correct and I'll give you the correct opinion to have on it as well. And that's why you watch. I'll tell you what to think about it. You don't worry. So we should just get right into that. There's a few short things at the top here. First of all, I want to thank Alex Paradeef, one a great guy, good friend, friend of the show. He's done some of our previous podcasts. live art, such a tremendous talent. And we are actually excited that we're doing a collaboration that comes out this Friday with them. And they're really, really beautiful pieces. Look at that. Oh my god. I'm so excited for this. This is my favorite draw. That's all original art that you drew by hand. I hope we're able to buy the, I think he'll sell us the The originals. Oh, that would be cool. Dude, he is so freaking talented. Holy shit. I own a few of his pieces in my house. One of them is this one piece, monster one. I don't know if you guys remember, but that's really cool. That's right. I have some of his prints as well. Oh, you do. Yeah. I'll actually, one of the cool things is we're going to be selling signed prints of him in yellow. Nice. You want to show off what you're wearing? Yeah. That's pretty cool, too. Yeah. That's it. The one, there's so many great pieces, so I don't really have, uh, on Friday when it comes out, I'll have more to show you guys, but, oh, here. Yeah, this is the piece of his that he made that I bought. Oh, yeah. Super stoked about this. It's beautiful. That's like the nice, I think it's got to be the nicest. piece of art on. It's so good, like good. You know, when you buy like a master artist and you get real close up, you know, like how do they do that? Like how are their strokes so clean and the color so perfect and even? And that's this, that's this pain. It is nice. Also, he's the nicest guy. He actually is. He's so sweet. He sent me a big package before my first creator clash. Really? With a bunch of stuff. He's so thoughtful. Yeah, he texts me every year on my birthday. What? Such a nice guy, yeah. I remember he was super sweet to Cam. Yeah, I got close to him through Cam. I think the first time I'm hung out with him was with Cam. Yeah, he's genuinely such a great guy. And look at this guy. Look, my hat doesn't fit my fat head. Stop. No. I got it. I'm fat. Shut up, XQC. Anyway, so that's exciting. That's coming out on Friday. Stay tuned for more details on that. And we're going to start off with Zach, actually, and Ian had an account, a close encounter of the third kind, was that what they call it? It really is, right? I mean, she is kind of an alien. It was a trip, man. What happened? Tell us. So, Ian and I were out and about grabbing a bite yesterday, and who do we see? Walking, but none other than Joe Joe C. Wow! Now tell me what was she wearing, what was she walking, what was she in her, like how did you press? She was walking by herself. By herself, normal person. How was she dressed? Cool? She had a cool black t-shirt on. It wasn't like mega attention, gravity. Not at all. It's just normal, good person. I'm not sure. She's a person. And in an eye, we're on our way out. We're walking to my car and we see her and I'm like, oh shit, not my first reaction. I'm like, hey, JoJo. And then she said hello. And I'm thinking of myself after something like, what the fuck am I doing? I got to get her on the show. Absolutely, and you're intuition on that. I mean, I would love to have for on the show. You're 100%. Right. So she, well, hold on. But before you get into that, Ian started it. Ian was was pushing back. He thought it was too cringy. And there was a whole dialogue happening on our group chat of Ian. trying, looking for anyone to talk me out. That talk is act down, but of course none of us were looking to do that. But ultimately you won Ian over, right? Yeah. Ian, are you back there in the, in the dark? Yeah. Here, let me, let me add a line. Oh, the light is coming on. Oh, wow. What a big difference. Is it a candle? If Moodahar's, uh, I've been watching his content because they'll lie low cut. He likes. He likes himself. He sits in the total darkness and lights himself with his monitor. He is better lighting than you. Yeah, but mine has sort of a dramatic like a Scorsese sort of, you know, Dr. Island thing. Absolutely hard. It's a little more DIY. So mine's a little more intentional. So go ahead. What was here? Well, Zach, what happened was we walked past Joe Joe. We were going in the opposite direction. Zach said hello. She saw she, you know, registered us. We kept going. Then Zach wanted to go do a double back. And then we drove past her twice. And then you got your cars. We searched for her. We got her car and we looped. We looped back and we were like, oh, where the fuck did she go? You're looking for her car or crazy car. That, but she went into one of those stores. That was trying to spot her in a store. And we're circling. We passed her on the street twice. That's what I sent the voice message. And I said, if we go hunt her down, I feel like we're tracking her. And I am cringing a little bit. And then you guys all convinced that play the voice message. Is it, is that cool, Ian? Yeah, you can play it. All right. I kept saying I'm going to do it. I was set on doing it. And thank you. I mean, I understand both your perspectives, but ultimately I wasn't there. I don't have to deal with the cringe. Well, so I'm following Zach. He kind of led this charge. And then I'm just along for the ride. And he's going store to store trying to find her. And we enter store and she's in there. And Zach does this thing where he like starts looking at a shirt. Oh my goodness. And he's sort of And I think she saw her. I saw us. I'm pretty sure she saw us. And this store is so far from where we first passed. And then he, I go, Jojo's in here. And he kind of is looking away. And he's like, all right, let's go. I'm like, where are we going outside? And then we just suddenly leave the store. And I think she saw us in this store. He's like, no, we're going to go wait a little bit away from the store and then we'll catch her walking back. That was smart move. I didn't want to go up there in the store. I found another way. Why didn't you want to go up there in the store? It wasn't the movement. Were you trying to make it seem like you just accidentally ran into her again? Kind of, yeah. But there's always you believe that. And then the funny thing is we ran into fans. So I thought to myself, oh, this could help us to hear attention. See, we're not weirdos. Well, we might still be weirdos, but we also have fans. That's the only reminder for the audience. Zach is six, three as you're listening to this story. And it's for not as it is for. The fans, Zachos, could you guys help us? If JoJo gets near us, can you come up and act like you know who we are? And that'll like subdue the situation. That's my goodness. I don't know that. And I'm like, you guys don't. He's crazy. He's like running away. You don't have to do that. I don't know. So what happened? Did they do it? Okay, so Ian's like, fuck this. I can't deal with this cringe. No, with all due respect, Ian. And he goes in a nice cream shop. And there's a bench right in front of an ice cream shop. So I sit down and I wait for it to walk. And I go up to her. Did you get ice cream? Did you get it? Did you end up getting ice cream? No, the line was too long. I just had to get away from Zagas. So I'm like sitting there like on my phone and she was carrying bags and shit and I say, I Joe Joe. And she was very friendly. I say, hi, Joe. My name is Zach. I'm a producer of the story podcast. We love you. We've been nothing but supportive of you. We would love to get you on the show. And she's like, let me, she gave me a contact. There it is. That's amazing. So well. So we got a contact. And we've reached out and really hope you could. Radio silence so far. I mean, it's been maybe a hour and a half. Yeah. Oh, you're already what? That's it. I sent it this morning. Oh, I thought you sent it like immediately. Okay. Okay. But a fairly personal contact. That's what I'm going to say. Really. This is what how we did to you. It wasn't really how we manned out her, which you would think it is exactly what he did to me. And you would think that it wouldn't work out, but in my case it worked out. Marvelously, so maybe this will turn into a great friendship. It was an opportunity that needed to happen. I need to get her away from James Charles. I can be the new man in her life. She was so nice. Not like that. No, I don't know. She invented Lesbian. Yes, I don't know. But it's just such any of that. In the few seconds that I was talking to her, she seemed like a very nice person. She seems like a very nice person. She seems like a great person. She looks super like a really nice person. She was buying some very cool t-shirts too. Can I ask you where she was shopping? Urban outfiters. Okay. Wonderful choice. They have teddy friends. So it's so real for you. That's actually so interesting. Because that's like, I mean, Urban Outfit is a nice story like Urban Outfiters, but very casual. And she looked like she would buy a lot of shirts, too. Maybe she's changing it up. I love someone with a lot of shirts. But absolutely. She was very friendly and a nice dress person. Love. You keep emphasizing. So it was in with you when you got the contact or were you solo? I was solo. He was in the ice cream. Were you watching from across the street or something? No, I was inside, and I could overhear Zack saying, you know, how supportive he is. I got the hoods, but man, I gotta do it. You know, you did the right thing. Absolutely did the right thing. 100%. I'm just imagining him, this guy, just going up, he's got a Hawaiian shirt on. It's the air's flowing, it's loose, it's low button. My name's Zack. This is the fourth time she's seen him in like four different locations. I gotta talk to you. There's no way she saw us in the store. There's no way. I feel like she's must. She thinks I know you're stalking her. But that's okay. It was like I said, I knew how we were stalking me and then it worked out great. It had to happen. It had to happen. There's no way it couldn't happen. I'm gonna say something about Jojo. Karma that song is in my liked songs every time it comes on. I'm like, what is this? And then it should have known better. Yeah. And then her new one, guilty pleasure. Yeah. So excited. Great. So excited. Unbelievable. So anyway, looking forward to hopefully hearing back and I, and you know, I'd love to build that bridge. That's a rainbow bridge that I'd like to walk over. Mario Kart reference. Jo Jo. Also rainbow signifies gay culture as well. Judgment does wear a lot of brambos. I am 15% gay. It is worth mentioning. That's great. Good work. Gentlemen. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah, Zach. I mean, really, thank you so much. I've done it without the moral support of you. Yeah. Even though you don't mean not to do it. Sounds like he was working against the fringe and I can't even look at you right now. It made me feel good though. Play the note, play the note, Dan. You have it? I do. All right, yeah, here on one second. Play. All right, Zack and I are in, we're out in the valley. We grabbed some food and walking down the sidewalk. We just passed Joe Joe Cua. Zack said hi, Joe Joe, and she said hi, and we kept walking. Now, Zack wants to turn around. Go find her. We just drove past her and he wants to corner her on the sidewalk and invite her on the show. I'm telling him that I will be cringing through my skin. But Zach here really wants to do it. I'm going to do it. You shouldn't do it. I don't know. I need opinions. And then obviously, I feel like you have to do it. About 15 seconds later, love replied do it and I replied with this. Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Oh, photo? That would have been worse. I might have waited her out. Yeah. No, not for professionals. Just eating a casual photo from the ice cream shop when you were chatting. Well, yeah, take a casual photo from the dressing room, peeking out of the curtain. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot my only take it right on my chest. A big telephoto lens. Yeah. It's classy. If I could give Ian some credit when we met Austin McBroom, we all kind of like, We wanted, I forgot what it was. We wanted to record him on video and like, mean Ian already like super shaky and probably scared the fuck out of him and like we walked away and we're like oh we missed opportunity and Ian's like should we go back and I'm like I'm not going back and he went back in alone and I forget what it was but he got like a video with him. They probably thought he was a serial killer but he's still the deal on that one. And that's, you know. We all have our moments. Zach, you had a moment. Ian, you had a moment. Abraham, you had a moment today. You were laying on the bathroom floor and stalling that bed day, which I greatly appreciate. Yeah. I remember, Abraham passionately following, trying to find out, what's it James Charles with the devil? Yeah. Yeah. I certainly do remember that. And what happened with that? We actually did meet James Charles. We just haven't. I haven't talked about it, but Lena met James Charles at her event. No, you guys saw him in the mall. You guys saw him in the mall. Oh, the follow up. We talked about the mall. You met him at the mall, right? Yeah. But that time we didn't ask for a picture. So the next time I met him, I made sure to just in case you guys didn't believe me. Wait, you out. So this is new. We didn't want to share it because we don't want to like We're promoting him or whatever. We're just doing it for the meme to prove that we actually met him, but no we didn't share it on the show. Promoting him or you know, I know people who don't are not familiar with the show won't get sent me the picture then. I can send you, are you smiling in it? I'm not in it. No, I wasn't there. They're not you smiling in it? Um, I didn't look a little. That's damning. She was on the cover. And then also, I'm like, maybe this is kind of crazy because like, no, I'm not a fan of him and I'm like, oh, can I take a picture? But it's just in case you guys don't believe me. No, it's okay. You can denounce him. You can show the picture and then make an official denunciation of him. Okay, I'll show you guys. Yeah, that'd be great. We can do that. or working on learning the family name. Oh, by the way, did I? So we made official plans, by the way. That on August 12, Monday, I am going to Las Vegas to participate in the celebrity poker game. Oh, my God. I am so excited. I know. And we're working on producing it, so we'll be alive, like usual. So we'll be able, hopefully what we're working on is I can do a little IRL stream before and after and then we can use their feed so you guys can see my cards in such but then like Dan, AB and Lena are gonna come with to help produce and then Dan and the crew will be here making commentary on my game. And it's a table of nine celebrity players. Guess that makes me a celebrity. I don't know. It's basically a winner take all. Yeah, winner take all. So first place gets 10,000 clams and second place gets 5,000 clams. If I win, I'll put it all on green. All right. That's my main. Or what if I did it all on black at least? Nah, I greens better. You're one more. How much would you win 10,000 on green? That would be crazy. I think it's times 14 or 28 depending on the size of the table. 28. So you could, so I could turn 10,000 to 280,000. I think so if one, that's crazy. That'd be easy. That's like huge. That's so scary though to put that. But anyway, I do plan on winning. Clearly I'm, Extra I'm an extraordinary poker player and I don't expect the competition to be stiff. Oh my god. This is this is very intimate. I don't know if we should share this. No, don't share it. Don't share it. Just you can confirm that You look great later. Thank you. You really are glowing. Thanks. But event was this. The Patrick Tom Beauty event. Why did releasing his new highlighters? He got so close to you. Looks like you guys are best friends. That's what I was telling AB2 when I showed him the picture later, because I'm like can I take a picture and I held up my phone, but I didn't realize like And nothing weird to him. I mean, you know, he's a professional and it comes to this stuff, like, you know, taking photos, but... It's a professional, uh, picking up minors on Snapchat, better than anything. Anyway, you wanted to announce him now? Yes, definitely. I officially announced James Charles. Thank you. Why? For many reasons. A minor... Don't get too cocky, then yeah, I know. I'm certain that I'm gonna lose. I'm gonna get a bad beat on the first hand, I'll go all in. Someone will go in with two seven and pull a full house on me, something. I'm being cocky and silly, I'm just having fun though. It should be really fun, I hope. It'll be an interesting and different experience for everyone. Getting some really, we already talked about, this was another event that James was at. We talked about it before and he was in the background with Mina's friend was at event, but this is a different one. Yeah, you guys, you guys really hit it off. Good job. Yeah. You're cheek to cheek, practically. I didn't even realize until I saw the photo honestly. I mean, it's pretty gracious of him, I guess. He was like, I wouldn't get that close as to a fan photo. Yeah, honestly, I did find it strange when I looked at the phone right the photo after, but at the same time, it was very shady of me and that's why I didn't immediately share this photo. I don't think it's shady. I think it's funny. Also you look beautiful. You should crop like Ethan's face onto the photo on post. I see then that would be yeah. I'm curious if you guys would probably be at another event together. I'm curious if I'll say anything. Should I be worried next time? No, just make sure you record it. Okay. She posted with Epstein. Yeah, that was in a, when you took a photo with Epstein, that was too far. I can't allow that. I can't say that I condoned that. I was just doing it for the show. No, we appreciate it. Uh, we're getting some extraordinarily generous donations. I want to thank, uh, first of all, Powska 101 says I am the bell and new. I'm the new bellist Simmons. I am the weed fairy. You're all blessed with weed and love. Love you, family. Wow. What is that mean, exactly? Powska 101, what a generous donation. Thank you so much. And another one. Also, I am super high at low, low, low, low, low Olivia. Yeah. Well, Olivia, you're my queen. All of you are. I love you. I love you, Pau. Pau, Pau, what's going on?

What can be unburdened by what has been? What the fuck does that mean? Coconut. Oh, I'm not caught up with all the, I'm not all caught up with the camera. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? Coconut book and be unburdened by what has been coconuts in Barbados. Coconut and Kamala. Literally. Thank you guys, that's so nice. I really appreciate that. Oh, and Post Scott, what is going on here? She just gifted 50 memberships, too. It's unbelievable. Jason, thank you. Wait, what the... Yeah, I know Dan is freaking out. Wait, what is this? This isn't recent, is it? No, it's old. Okay, well then, I'm not, oh, yeah, you could tell. I know they have a weird history where James was like coming onto him like... I do remember that he was making him actually uncomfortable. No surprise. No surprises there, eh? Jeff is just his type. Okay. Straight. That's true. Not exactly his time. Almost. So thank you to that. Thank you to Zach. I hope that works out and Ian, thank you for the most support. Very exciting, very exciting. All right. So let's go ahead and get into this. We're at 25 minutes already. I'd be one of you. We set up for the Toshi or no. No, next time. Next time. Well, you guys know I'm a, I'm a, but day enthusiast. Yeah. I used to be heavy into the baby wipes. And I was against the bid day. I thought it was a savage practice. What is that? That's Rage on how he's talking about. Yeah, it's okay. Okay, okay. Yeah, how he was showing him. Yeah. That's right. I remember that. Come to the very, it comes in handy. So hit me with that. Sweet exciting music. Not that. Not that. The music. Hit me with that. I used to be a bad day hater, but I learned that using Babywipes actually creates an enemy of the people, a fat burg. And that changed everything when I learned about that. Some farmers wrote us and said, hey, the Babywipes, they say it's flushable, but that's alive. It's a Babywipes fraud happening right under our nose, and it stinks. I said, I said it's no, I said it stinks which is a play on the fact that it's a doo-doo melody. It's a doo-doo joke. And then doo-doo jokes. Yeah, but so I had to swear off the baby wipes and I never thought I would be able to get the kind of clean that I am now getting from the days and honestly I don't have I'm not even touching my ass anymore which is somewhat revolutionary so I stopped even I stopped even washing my hands now what I should there are good reasons to wash your hands that's a joke of course I recommend washing your hands uh after every bathroom usage and frequently but the hell of touch sheet is a great way to begin the bidet adventure.

It's really what you know. We love you Tom. It's really cool. If you guys want to hear from Tom, he's always here on Thursdays. He sits on the on the members with us. Because we have meetings on Thursday. But he comes in with us any day. He's always a pleasure to have around. But there it is of that. Tommy Boy. All right. So let's move on to our headline story here. Eva. Eva Chris Tyson. You guys all know who this is. Mr. Beast, I believe his best friend since. childhood they made the mr. beast channel together and he has been central to the operation there for for a long long time I have met Ava One or two times I've spoken to her she is was very sweet and lovely person when I met her however so at this at this point I'm trying to So here's my issue with the story right out at the top. I admit, so there's two things happening here. One is that there is some massive trans hysteria happening. That is playing up these crazy stereotypes about trans people all being like predators and child groomers and all this kinds of stuff. But on the other hand, there is very legitimate criticism here and wrongdoing on Ava's part. And so I do think it's important as we talk through this to try to differentiate the two. I mean, this story has enabled the worst kinds of people to say the worst kinds of things with impunity, relative impunity. So I want to just bear that in mind. as we discussed this here. And I really want to avoid being sensational about it and just going at this as level headed as possible. So we've put this together as thoroughly as we can. I've watched a lot. We've all watched a lot about it. And I think we've got at this point everything. We've got all of it. So let's go ahead and take a look here. So Ava is being accused at this point of having inappropriate relationships with two minors. That sounds really bad. Let's open it up. So there's basically two different minors here. One of them is this person lava. And then the other one is anonymous. So this one first will talk about lava, who was at the time 14 when he got was 22 or something. 20. 20. 14. So here's what we have. I guess that lava was on the Mr. B set and they met on set and they stayed in touch somehow for some reason. Now, as a 20-year-old, do I think it's appropriate to get a 14-year-old's contact and stay in... Oh, I think... Hold on a second. They met up in person when Lava was 16. I thought they met on Mr. Beast's set. That's what I heard. How did they meet? Okay, I'll move on. As you guys look into that. So here is them talking on Twitter. Please stream again, and he says, I'm sorry. Ava says, forgive me. It's difficult for me because I'm looking at this old stuff that says Chris, so if I'm getting the pronouns wrong, forgive me. But Ava says, thanks, Dad. You want to moderate it. Now, again, at the time, lava was in this one, 14. And so, I think asking the fourth year old to moderate your life is a little odd for sure. And also calling a fourth year old dad is pretty on comfy. I will say that back in 2018, I feel like that was a meme that everyone was calling each other dad. I remember post Malone used to call me dad all the time. I thought it was odd, but I didn't question the kids. Could does anyone corroborate that? The dad phenomenon? Yeah. I remember that. Yeah. Mm. Um, a lot of times I find that on the internet, there's like these metas that take place. Like, there was a time on the internet where everybody was joking about microwaving babies and shit. You know, there was like a dead baby joke, Renaissance. You remember that? I mean, I remember dead baby jokes from when I was like in elementary school and middle school. Okay. Well, so my point is that maybe it had a resurgence later as well, but we go through various meds and sometimes when you look back on it, it looks totally unhinged and insane. It's sure, yeah. You know, that was gorgeous. It is. Yeah, probably is objectively, you know, but at the time for some reason, whatever reason. So that, but I mean, obviously, I think there's, there's obviously a difference between calling someone older dad. I thought that was what you did because post was calling me dad. I said, I'll use calling you an older dad and calling a 14 year old dad. That's dad. Okay. So that's what we have. Here's some more continuing. Chris or Ava's responding to lava. I posted some fire nudes for you. Please no share. That's pretty nuts. Again. I know there was the fucking sound by it. The video prism 42 claims Tyson was 20. And lava was 13 at the time. They're online communications began. Among the accusations, uh, prism points out to an alleged snapchat, Tyson messaged lava of her face with the text coming for America. I've seen that one. Yeah, we'll get to that. But, uh, the age was 13. That's, that's, That's a relationship that you need to be extraordinarily careful with and probably shouldn't take place at all. A 20-year-old in a 13-year-old is pretty bananas. I would say that that's just on the face unacceptable. Yeah, not to also to add to it being a creator viewer. There's more dynamics between that that's even might make it even worse, you know. And at the time was how popular was Mr. Beast in 2018? That was the beginning of kind of the rise, right? And he's been around forever. Yeah, I'm checking right now. I think that was like around the time Logan Paul shouted him out, but I'm looking at his social blader. I want to say that was when I first became aware of him and we had him on our show in 2018, I believe, too. So he was the beginning of him really starting to blow up. Yeah. That was during the T series. So he was huge then. He was going big already. Because I remember he was like a central part of this whole T series. Yeah. But at any rate, I think this relationship, definitely a famous YouTuber by that point. Yes. And I think this relationship even began from Ava being famous, you know? I think they casually met in the other way. He had, sorry, he had a million subs in 2017 by 2018, he had 10 million. So that was his big year. Yeah, it was like when it was all blowing up for him. So, love us talking, it seems like to, I know, love is responding to an Ava tweet. Also, we keep saying 20, I don't think that that's correct, at least at the time of these, because this is 2018. You can do the math. Ava is 28 right now, and this was about six years ago. So we've been like 22. 22 and 13. 13, 14. I don't know there are exact birthdays, but it's in fact that. It's in that range. Yeah, that's best. Okay, so lava responds to a post of avas and then ava, I think it's a link to the discord or something, patreon, and avas says I posted some fire nudes for you, please know share, which is really, you know, not a good thing to say, do it 13 years old. No, no, please. So let's keep going here. Here's lava again responding to Eva and Gamers up. Shout out. We love them. I love how I set that embed up so it shows you looking sexy. Lava said to Chris. And he said, thanks, lava, lava, lava. I mean, this one, I mean, it's, yeah, it's inappropriate, but Yeah, I mean, it adds to the certainly the environment. Here's a lot of it in the discord with Ava practice with this banana. Is there no context to this? Like, certainly whoever clipped this has the problem. That was a singular screenshot. Yeah. All of this is lacking a lot of code. We should acknowledge. And, you know, obviously, I think we agree that somebody in their mid 20s should not have kind of like a friendly, edgy borderline sexual relationship with the actual teenager regardless of the context. But yeah, a lot of this see this is where it all gets complicated because like you mentioned I mean there there is sort of like this this trans hysteria stuff going on and this is why we were very careful on Monday because without shouting out anybody specific just know that these all of these like revelations are coming from very much alt-right spaces, you know what I mean? And so, you know, we should evaluate the evidence on its face and be fair in our judgment of it. But that context I think is important to note too, because it is definitely people that are actively going after her and trying to convey things in the worst way possible. And so yeah, a lot of this is just like very like the banana photo. It's just like I have no idea what they're even talking about here. It seems to me as Dan said that this story has been spearheaded by a transphobic people. And so when I see a screenshot like this with zero context, like actually gone out of their way to remove context, then I'm going to take these types of evidence with a lot of, a lot of, let's go up to go on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whereas there's some stuff on its faces, Dan said this just, you know, yeah, just, it is what it is. So that's what I'm trying to be careful with here. So I don't know what the fuck this one is. It doesn't sound good, but again, I don't know what they were talking about. I saw someone ask is Chris Ava's previous name. Yes, I will. I'll just try to say Ava Chris Tyson, because I don't want to miss. She still goes by Chris as a middle name now. So Ava Chris Tyson, everyone understands. So anyway, Ava, Chris Tyson, that's a lot to say every time, isn't it? I'll just say. My friend, uh, lava is live on Twitch, Ghostbam, Lobster and Chat. I don't, I failed to see the, significance of this one other than that they were intimate they were friends they were friendly and yeah I guess just showing all of the interactions that we're still publicly findable on Twitter so this is his basically the sum of his interactions of her interactions with the ava and I mean that alone by itself certainly makes you raise an eyebrow. But let's keep going. Eva and a few friends allegedly hang out with lava when lava was 16 years old. Here is the gang. Now, what does this, I mean, I do wonder why, why are they so close? Like they stayed in touch since lava was 13, and I love a 16. And they're all hanging out here. So real to work? They were modding a discord, by the way. Ava was modding, or something, lava was modding, Chris, or Ava's. Okay, let me check it. Lava was modding Ava's discord. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy too. Because everybody knows that the kind of stuff that shows up in the mod log of discord can be absolutely bananas. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We're actually here, finally employing, you know, like you're using like child labor. Yeah. Well, but also, I mean, that is certainly one concern, but my concern is all the shit you're going to see in the mod log on this. That's true, too. Yeah. The most horrible shit you can imagine, you know. You probably want more mature people doing the moderating. That's basically like you know how there's like a few FBI people that have to like review all the child pornography that they collect from Yeah, it's it's basically that's the job. It's like that. Hopefully it's not that bad, but that is a real job which is actually bananas Yeah, I mean, there's definitely going to be porn. I still feel like I'm coming up. Like not even people. There's a lot of bots that just spam porn on discord. I mean, yeah, you can guarantee it. Yeah, definitely 100% I'm all on discord. We'll see in the kind of shit exploding milk. It's actually pretty bad. So what do you guys make of this one? It's just I guess there. They've stayed in touch. The year on this one is 21. This photo was from 2020 July 28, 2021, that's not that long ago. The first minor who was 20 now, lava, released a statement saying that they never felt victimized by Ava and that the worst crime that Ava did was make AG jokes so let's go ahead and take a look at that. So here's lava now as an adult 20 years old closer to an adult anyway. And lava says this about one of these original. She was 10. It's over for Chris Tyson. These videos are massive lies, love is said. And twisting the truth, Eva never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of. Can you do me a favor and comment on these videos and tell them to stop spreading lies? The situation takes away from children who are actively being exploited every day online. I'm not a victim of anything being claimed in these videos or at all. Now certainly just because the victim potential victim says nothing happens certainly doesn't mean that nothing happened but I do think that it is certain it is important to take their account and it's very important sure and actually you should look at the next link because there's there was even further further updates via a keemstar actually um... who i guess spoke directly to lava so keems a more specific uh... denials uh... can you get your shot can start uh... tweeted corroborating details from lava let's take a look now which isn't okay mr. beast connect me directly to lava the alleged crisp so it he's he's saying mr. he's saying that jimmy is involved in this now like directly Oh, yeah, I imagine so there's a PR disaster for Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast, why I can't handle that Mr. Beast takes King Star like as a serious. No. No, no, no, no. Like he's giving him the exclusive, you know what I mean? I can't handle that. Clearly deal with it but he says not been keeping up with local live. Like me. Anyway, Kim says Mr. Beast connect me directly to lava the alleged Ava Chris Tyson grooming victim. lava says I was not groomed by Chris Tyson. lava said I did not meet Chris Tyson by myself. I met Chris and Mr. Beast crew with my family present. Lava also said I ran a discord with Chris Tyson when I was 13 and edgy and appropriate jokes were said that's it. So I mean, Lava who's not 20 years old says that they were not victimized. So that I think, you know, It's certainly something. It's not that last thing that they confirm that they're doing as a denial is not really doing any favors. It's like I ran a discord when I was 13 and all there was was edgy and appropriate jokes. Well, that's you shouldn't do that. Like that's that right there is worthy of Chris. Well, you were 13 and Eva was an adult. Right. Clear. Yeah. We acknowledge that like there's certainly been some boundary breaking here that has made any reasonable person uncomfortable with the relationship that an adult is having with a child. However, it doesn't appear And here's the top comment in sending sexual jokes to 13 or what more needs to be said. I mean, to an extent, I agree that that is not good. No, not to an extent. I agree that's not good. I don't know what needs to be said more. Well, what is the accusation exactly that that Ava's caruming this person first? So it's being largely reported and framed as an inappropriate sexual relationship with the minor. I think it is kind of close to that. Right. I mean, sexual, this is so loaded. Like, I mean, that can mean so many different things. Like, was Eva Chris Tyson sending news? Right. Right. Or was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was It is similar to the calling stuff, I guess, in a way, isn't it? I mean, children shouldn't have that kind of relationship with adult. That's actually a family. It's just weird. It's like it's so obviously loaded. No, you're talking about calling. Oh, yeah, it's so calling. Yeah, calling stuff. Yeah. Colleen sent like, Newt's of adults to the minors and stuff, which I did not know. Definitely is a step up from what's being alleged here. Also, like the tampon in the mouth and all. Right. It's it. I would. So play though. There's more. There's more. There's a differentiation from the Colleen. Listen, I'll be totally honest that there are by I have biases, right? Like I have been friendly with Ava, I like Mr. Beast, and I'm also defensive about transphobia. And so I'm fighting my own, I'm just going to be told that I'm fighting my own biases, and I'm trying to be as partial as possible about this. So forgive me if I'm battling myself here as we go through this. But I mean, obviously there's a lot of similarities to the calling situation. You know, I feel like for a child to have a relationship with an adult, like that's very inappropriate, almost sexual, not that might cause issues further in life, not saying it happened in this case, but in a lot of cases that happens where things become weird for the child growing up, you know? Sure. Sure, yeah. So that's what that is, okay? um... and came reported this and so yeah that's that's that's what that is all right uh... there's a lot more um... now a snapchat message between ava and an unnamed fourteen-year-old boy have been leaked this is totally anonymous we don't know where it came from how it was obtained, or any, where did this originate? Where was this first? So, again, without getting too specific, because I don't want to give these people attention, but this is also coming from fortune and gripper world. So, but how did they get this? They don't say? Not that I could determine. Interesting. So any recording though that you know Ava a spoiler alert for anybody that didn't hear but in her resignation tweet did not deny anything really and so Not. I think the huge reason to be, you know, obvious that this real, going through it. It's obvious that this is real. I've more of a concrete answer of where it came from. It was posted to X by the user at little no name for real. What's the name of the account? They posted all of them and then they deleted it and it was archived and reposted, which is the tweet that I believe. This person is claiming to be the recipient of these messages or they didn't make any other statements about it. Right. No, they just. They said, threw it out. Here it is, and then they bailed. Yep. Interesting. That is pretty, okay. So anyway, I'm not questioning the authenticity, by the way. I'm just saying, I don't know. There's, again, a lot of context that's been perposed, seems like purposely removed. For whatever that is, reason that is, we'll have to try to think about it. So here's more drama alert. Now, came as a chip on a shoulder about the avastoff and honestly rightfully so issues I have with Ava's behavior throughout all this is her interaction with a lollie artist. And this specific lollie artist had drawn a sexual image of Keem's daughter. And she was like 12 or something. I mean, what does it matter about it? I'm pretty sure. Just absolutely vile vile vile stuff. So Keem is 100% justified, you know, uh, in this case, which might be the first time I've ever said that and may ever say that. So there it is. Uh, overnight more allegations on Ava Chris Tyson have been posted in the social media, alleged 2019 snapchat message between Ava Chris Tyson and a 14 year old at the time. We're posted to X, but we're taking down. However, later, they were republished by other users. Former Mr. Beast team member, Jake the Viking, quote tweeted a repost implying they are real, but by saying there's more. One post has since gained 2 million views. Do you believe these messages are real? Okay. Well, let's take a look. Now again, bear in mind that GNN stands for gripper. I don't know if that's exactly what it is, but it's very if you look at it, it's very obviously like a. We're tweeting the Quintos videos and stuff. Actually, because I think that's pretty interesting. I think gun news. Whatever gun to's. I guess. I mean, they've always inventing some new word shit to like confuse the normies. We're guns. Cool and tweez with Nick Fuantos. So there you go. Yeah, there you go. Um, so this accounts as Chris Tyson employee of Mr. Beast, who's best known for being trans and buying lowly con from Shadman. I don't know if that's what it what she's best known for. has been caught sexually messaging a different 14-year-old. Shared by the then 14-year-old is a snap-chop conversation between the victim and Tyson in 2019. Let's take a look at it. Impact confirmed. The Slayer has been activated. Demonic threat level increasing all the night. Power of hell. It's software presents do the Dark Ages available now on Xbox Series X of this PlayStation 5 at PC rated M from a chore There's a video here next slide So here is the entirety I believe of their text Um, messaging. There's another voice message which we'll watch after. But let's look at this closely and try to take it all in. So this took place on Snapchat, which is already a red flag, you know what I mean? Yep. The reddest of flags. Yeah, I do Snapchat needs to be. TikTok is being shut down. We need to shut down Snapchat. Hi, great. We need a Congress to move on. Snapchat. Bye bye. TikTok. We'll talk about it. I'm saying bye-bye. Let's not do it. We do the apple. Start them all down. Oh, you're waiting for that. Not until we can really do it all mistake. We explain. All right. Once I do the dance, we can shut down TikTok. We can talk about it then. For sure. I do it for that. All right, girl. I'll meet you. I'll meet you back after. Who's the new speaker of the house? Oh my god. Call me Mike Johnson. Oh my god. All right, Mike Johnson. Is that fucking awesome? That's his name, Mike Johnson. I mean, it's it's too on the nose, almost. He's a laboratory bread wipe off. He really is. Johnson. Mike Johnson. Sounds like a fake name, frankly. Okay, so let's take a look. Here it is a bin. So just to be clear, the blue ones here, that's Ava crit, right? Yep. Okay, so she said bin wrapped up low, thanks dad, low, keep it a secret, though, low. I can't read what was quote tweeted here. It looks like it's a screenshot of a DM. Oh, I really like to know what that was, but it's just too low. Yeah. Res. Also, the thick blue lines mean that it was saved in chat at the time, because usually the messages will delete immediately unless you're wondering about that. Yeah, if you hold it down, you could save it in chat. Doesn't it tell the other person? It does tell the other person. Yeah. So it was no secret, even that it was being saved. Yeah. Chris sends a heart or Ava Chris sends a heart. I mean, it's clearly the real account. Seems pretty obvious. Oh, here we get to see this. Okay, so here is the DM that was a secret. It says, oh shit, so fast. It says, I don't know if you heard about my bathwater prank, and how crazy it's gone, but my stock is actually sold out at the moment. Rather than bringing it back, I'm actually looking to bottle a whole bath on video into a giant tub and ship it to whoever buys it for $20,000. I just wanted to reach out and advance because I know this is the kind of content Mr. Beast does just to give you a heads up. Let me know if this is a message from Belleville, fam. Oh, you're right. Wait, what? Okay, you're right. I understand what the water, the bath water. She's trying to get him involved, which is funny. She says, this is kind of content, Mr. Beast says, just give you a heads up. Let me know if this is something that might interest him. Thanks. What possibly? I'm sending a hundred. I'm sending 10,000 people. Viles of Bell Daphne's. Side bath water. Okay, so basically it seems like Ava Chris sent is just sending some insider. Yeah. But just, but just kind of weird because you're, you're using your, place of privilege and access to. We can be honest. Well, there's this might be grooming in this sense that. Create AvaCris is using their special position to get close to a child. And it's seem cool. Good point. And they're comfortable with this. This is, in my opinion, is highly inappropriate to be a conversation we have with a. That's a good point. Now, do we know for sure that the age of this person? It seems like we don't really know much for certain at all about this person. This person claims to have been 14 when when Avo was 22. Where was that claim made? In the original. That was a race. It was just that. It was 14, 22. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we're taking I mean, listen, I have no, I can't really say that I should have a problem believing that because we already know that Ava Chris had a relationship with a 13 year old. Yeah. There's a precedent. Yeah. It's a pattern. Now, fortunately. Yeah, imagine that. I mean, how gross is that, right? Cavcav? In a probability relationship with a 40 year old, now, the department. Yeah, man. Also, maybe it's hard for me to explain, but the way you're saying that is grooming because he's using insider information. I feel like just for him to talk to another person is already like an insider thing because not everyone gets to talk to Chris from Mr. Beast. That's already a thing that's so special access. Yeah, that's already special access. Exactly. And this, in my opinion, is like, even the next layer. Yeah. For sure. Like, here's DMs from Bell Delphine. Yeah. Like, oh shit. Yeah. I'm getting hooked up with some really exclusive. And also, this victim was also referred to as dead. as well in those messages. Right. We talked about previously in the first case, but that was like public on Twitter, you know, one time, this one thing, but if there's a pattern of calling miners dead, it's a little fucked. I mean, it's, I think it's probably likely that at the time, Eva Chris was calling everyone dead. Yeah, I wonder if it was maybe maybe like a thing in discord. I don't like it. But but like, at us, but obviously you're like, we say family is like a code thing here on the podcast. You know what I mean? Obviously you need to think twice before calling a child dad because that is obviously weird. It feels a little weird regardless of what you're used to saying. You know, is a child man. You got to be careful. You communicate with children. I mean, my kids call me dad every night and I'm just like, kids, stop. Stop. That is so inappropriate. Dad's. All right, let's keep going. So Eva Chris sent the DM and then a heart, which is weird. It is weird. seemingly out of the blue on that one. Oh wait, because these are the only ones that are safe. Right, so we don't have the context on that as well. Keep it a secret. Thanks, Dad, been stepped up. Low, sent a soundcloud song. Mine's better. I'll email you my PC. Yeah, low, are you really ha ha, Walmart, low, true vine God. So these were just the ones that were saved. Right. Yeah. They don't seem these particular ones don't seem particularly remarkable. I'm not sure why they would just save true. They were a kid, you know? Yeah. Talking to someone famous, anything significant. But if they were having longer conversations, why save, like, just whoa. You save things by just holding your thumb on the message? Could be an accident. I've never used Snapchat for the time. Yeah, I've saved messages all the time, but I accident. Okay. No, it happens. It's not like that could have explained it. Not that many, though. Like, me and Lena are talking on Snapchat since 2014, I probably saved three times. Okay. Maybe those little fingers aren't. They're not as nimble as yours. Stick your phone. Yeah. Anyway, it's on important. So here's the video. When this person said when Nope. Ava Chris said when is your wedding you can do what when it's your wedding you can do what you want. Okay. Um. This is the best snapchat I've ever seen Chris said Ava Chris said to this person. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah, replied to the person's story or something like that, right? Okay. I haven't used Snapchat in 10 years. Yes. It looks like Eva responded to their story. This is the best snap I've ever seen. Okay. Of course, Dad. Kissy face. Do you think the kissy faces? I don't like those. Yeah, it's very intimate. That's too much. Yeah. I will say it's all too much. Snapchat with a fan is too much. Yeah. I'm implementing building a relationship with a child. It's just all fucking weird. Ava Chris is making the initiative in a lot of these in this specific one. a lot with the DM, the responding sending the kissy faces. That's, this is all quite bad. I mean, this all by itself, I feel like. There's more that makes it worse. However, so all this just alone, the combo of, of Ava Chris talking to, Both of these kids is enough for like some serious calling out and soul searching and potential explanations needed. This is, I feel like it's already pretty bad. You know. You know, he's a famous guy, even back then, and wanting to seek out relationship with kids. He's not doing that because he's lonely. He has a lot of people around here. He's friends with the cool student in the world. Yeah. Also he, or sorry, Eva Krishchev was, it sounds like getting married at the time. Because she said, well, if you're wedding, you can do whatever you want. And I know she was married. Right. So I don't know. Anyway. So let's see here, here is the voice message that were released by the same person. Let's see. I know. I know, dude, I would come inside of that egg and then watch her eat it. And then watch her have six with another man watching comments about how my genitalia can never satisfy her. Wait, wait, what the fuck was that? That was like, it's very vulgar. So hold on, for sure, this was the same person. This is from the same anonymous source on Twitter. And this is from the discord server. This is Eva Chris's special chat room. What was the call didn't call in have that, too? No, she didn't have a discord. She wasn't like that. She was like that. She was like that. She was like that. Colleen's cookies. Do you not remember? I think it's the cookies. No, what? I don't think so. I don't think so. Chloe and Dweeney's. Dweeney's. Dweeney's. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat. Dweeney's chat compared to the other group chat because there's no reason they need to be on Snapchat whatsoever especially I was curious if they had discord at the time if they're in discord together like Yeah, there's no reason we have SNAP. Well, they can DM on discord Yeah, they can DM on discord if it's the mod I mean, oh, this person wasn't a mod right? No. Yeah, either way. They've just talked about this hard to submit So This means that they recorded it back then which is interesting. Isn't it? Uh, yeah. You can see at the very bottom, actually, that this is a desktop recording 2019 April 7th. So, oh, there's actually a date here. So we impend this down to it seems like it wasn't that way more like the person who recorded this was like, I'm going to record this spot. It could have just been they were desktop recording. the whole day. That does appear to be a, yeah, like a desktop recording. So that makes sense. Yeah, it's just because it's a big creator and like they thought it was cool. They want to record it. Very right. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me hear that again. I know, dude, I would come inside of that egg and then watch her eat it and then watch her have six with another man watch. She comments about how much unity a can never satisfy. Dude, that is Extraordinary disgusted Okay, if yours talking like that with kids in the room though then This is my first time hearing this I didn't I didn't go over this this specific video I haven't seen this this is GG in my opinion if this is a 13 year old and adult twenty-year-olds and they're talking about this. Fourteen supposedly. Fourteen. And again, it is. Yeah. I mean, we don't have, like you said, we don't really have a reason. We don't, we don't have direct evidence of that, but we also don't have a great reason to be skeptical of it because of the law of the situation, which was also somebody in that age range. So that makes that claim. It makes more sense to me that it is a minor. You know what I wonder? And I saw someone pose this. If Belle Delphine can confirm that she actually sent that DM, because like, I don't think it's talked about anywhere. If she can confirm that she actually sent that, it would kind of prove the validity of these screenshots. I don't question the validity. Those are, yeah. No, I mean, me neither. But they told me she ain't going to be in a rush to kick them off. I guess in the end. To involve herself in this situation. I don't, I'll tell you why I don't question it is because the way that they click around and show it all, it's pretty clearly real. Like, this would have had to be very expensive. I don't even have to convince me, I know. Well, again, the biggest evidence towards that is that Ava Christ didn't deny anything. Correct. Yeah, I mean, she denied being a groomer as you would expect, but no specific. There was no specific like, there's fake, you know, if it was fake, I would say that. I would say this is made up bullshit. Absolutely. Yeah, so let me hear this again, because it is, and I'm sorry, but this truly is like a smoking gun for me. I know, dude, I would come inside of that egg and then watch her eat it, and then watch her have sex with another man. Watch her comments about how my genitalia can never satisfy her. Dude, the level of detail, that is not a joke. That is a man who is just unloading his weird sexual desires in a room full of kids. Yeah. That's disgusting. That's beyond the industry. Yeah, that's not it. You say that's what beyond edginess. Right. Oh, dude. No. That's that's pervert. That's pervert. Yeah. 100%. Because I see a lot that that we're being thrown around. This one doesn't get it that one. I could see like there's some plausible accountability with some of the stuff we've seen, but this one doesn't get that. That's disgusting. Wow. Jesus, man. You know, I hope people start learning by now that you can't get away with anything on the internet. Like, everything you do will come out. Good. Everything. Somehow, some way, it always comes out. So stop fucking around you, it is. You know, get your shit together. Let's see. So there was sorry the voice mess wasn't there another one another voice message Thought there was multiple. Yeah, there is any click the second one here. I hope he gets cancer in the mouth Same chat room. I hope he gets cancer in the mouth I gotta say that is one of the not good places. He goes his entire life, not smoking your single cigarette, and then when he gets 80, he just gets fucked with some, but some dude with some cancer dick, and he shoves it in his mouth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. From cancer dick. I hope he gets cancer in him. That's what happened to Walter White. And he got cancer dick. He got cancer dick. I think it's nice that he at least said, wait till they're 80, they do it. I mean, that one is, obviously, that one fails in comparison to the first one, so whatever. Now let's get to the lolly stuff, which before I saw that video, I thought was the worst part. We've all directed to lolly at some point or another. No, no. I think some people have, but certainly not all of us. And fact. Oh, geez. You might have a new compatriot here. Do a share notes with. Eva's previous support of a Lolli artist is now coming back to light. Now we talked about this. Talk about it during the vows. Right, people had were bringing it up, but and I think There was a lot of benefit of the doubt happening that it was like super long ago that Ava Chris was super like at in 2016 how old was was Ava Chris then? 2016 that would be eight years ago. So 20 or so? I mean, it's still old enough to know better, but yeah, I think it's pretty saucy. I think a lot of the, yeah, well, this, um, this Malali artist that we're about to talk about, uh, that, uh, she pretty clearly was a fan of, um, it's like, I've been seeing a bunch of people, like, I had never heard of this person, but apparently they were like, at one point pretty popular. So I think what happened was this. I think what happened was this. Shadmaster, right? Shadman. Shadman. Shadman. But what I believe happened, and hopefully someone correct me if I'm wrong, is that he was a normalish artist that had a big fan base, and then this person switched to doing like straight up like lolly. So they weren't always known for that. It just became like their thing. I mean, that would Yeah, if they like eased into it, it would make more sense. I believe that's that there was like this degree of support for this person at one point, but yeah, I don't know. I don't know the whole history of this, but I know it ain't good. I know it ain't good. But I mean, so when you combine all of this with this new information to me is when it all, it's like, alright. Exactly. But, um, what can we do? You're fucking weirdo. Here's the thing. Again, I'm emitting my biases. I wanted to give Avo the benefit of doubting this one as much as I could, however. I'm seeing people, by the way, disagree with your characterization. I think they were always known for it. But then I can't, I just have a hard time believing that so many Because there was like another creator in Galali openly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was no, but there's like mainstream creators that followed this person. Yeah. Like a lot. That's what, that's what trips me out. That's what trips me out to. I, I just, I gotta. I gotta. I can't believe it. But I don't know anything about shadmance. Okay, I'm seeing alternating things now. So I'll look into it a little more because I'm seeing no shadmance used to be normal. That's what I around for a long time. I remember hearing about them in early 2010 was big on pre not safe for work band Tumblr right right they got rid of all that and deviant art. Yeah. Okay. Also, very big on YouTube. There's like videos from 11 years ago, Sheldra's cartoon. Do it done, like, read done in NSFW. Someone's looking at that so we can be more definitive with it, but I'll move on for now. History of Shadman. I just thank you. Yeah. You found something? Yeah. I found their wiki thing. All right. I'll move on for now and you guys let me know when you got something there. Oh, Michael. But as I was saying is that I was kind of allowing it, giving myself the giving him the benefit as much as I could with this kind of like, oh, well, Shadman was once normal and who knows, uh, But I don't, I just think that I can't do that anymore. In the totality of everything, it makes all this look worse. And I just can't rationalize it, really. So anyway, Ava says, nothing gets my knob a crank in like some lollip. That's it. It's such an insane thing to say. It's sick. Oh boy. What are the chances that Eva Chris is joking here? I would say at zero percent. Initially it was, a lot of people said that this was just an edgy joke. But when the whole thing, she's buying art, exactly when the whole thing unravels that she's, she's buying art of lawly, right? She's clearly a fan of Shadman. Then all of a sudden this can't be a joke because you don't support. So this is, in my opinion, definitely not a joke. This is as much of a joke as when Vash says, everybody's been, everybody jerks off the law. We were exactly right. That's not an edgy joke, my dude. Some of these girls looked at me. That's an admission. Nothing gets my knob of a crank in like some lolling. here's another one from avocress bonus fidget spinners to really throw in some extra autism and that he she added shed shed base which is now we yeah there's nothing overtly sexual about this but we just covered it because it it is it's gross it's gross but it's a child who is like doing the way go face or something she has a gun in her mouth Oh, that's weird. That's super weird. Yeah. What does that had say? Please be. It's not too patient. Oh, I think the last word is autism. Oh, right. Please be patient. I have autism or something like that. more info about Chad Man if we want it. I'm reading that before 2009 when they're online career like started picking up they were in art school and his portfolio was discovered containing drawings that were considered highly illegal and they were called a menace society which led to him being expelled from school and also this article says at the end that very recently in 2021 Chad Man was arrested for assault and attempting to murder a person with a deadly weapon in Los Angeles. So, we'll lock the doors. He returned to Twitter a month after to say not to worry he is doing fine and his post received mixed reaction. It was rumored he had an arrest record in Switzerland and he was detained for possessing hunting knives. Now, I will say what if the tie back to what I was alluding to earlier with the, uh, oh, Bell Delphine could verify this. Bell Delphine has known association with this person as well. With the Lali artist. Yep. I just don't understand what the fuck is happening. Where does there's like a list of people that were associated with this guy. And I don't want to read it off because there's no, I would want to verify. Yeah, I want to be a what their relationship was and what that means. But it was a long list, a very prominent online personality. I do believe that we should air it out, but I want to make sure before we read it. For sure. Because it didn't really have any context other than just a list of news. We've got a flight book here to be honest. We've got a flight book. Yeah. the Lolita Express. Yeah. So anyway, Ava bought art from this dude, really gross Lali art, and then tweeted to him. What the fuck did? I just, the world is so confusing to me because I see stuff like this, and it's so obviously fucked. that I just don't understand how nobody gave a fuck for so long. It doesn't it blow your mind? Yeah. I don't know. So anyway, there's more here. Avocress responded to this comic. Was this a Shadman thing or just a random? I believe that wasn't Shadman thing to me. So Shadman being the fantastic guy he is. uh... drew a comic of the two protagonists from gravity falls who are twelve-year-old twins boy and a girl making out that is just like what is wrong with that and another one from two thousand fourteen by citizen the bright side d a is cleaning my gallery i don't know that means but ever responded to this vile freak Bro, why don't we ask him why is this dude just drawing like sexual images of kids? What are we doing here? Why are people? Because there's people, there's people like Vouch that will, why are they all agree associating with him? It makes, it's crazy. I, that people get a little too comfortable. I think there was, you know, a little too comfortable. There's definitely some kind of like, weird mass. Like there's some kind of mass hypnosis going on here where the amount of people who were just consuming it probably just felt so normal. Yeah, they reinforce each other because they have these weird little niche communities online and you know, on either on Twitter or for China, wherever the fuck they congregate and You know, they're all juicing each other up. This is this is great. This is all normal. You know what I mean? How else? Like, because it's soon, and then it's soon, that's how you get the situation, like with Vowsh, where like, he's like acting shocked that like, people are accusing him of being a pedo for his weird ass fucking molly habits, you know? Um, okay. So people are saying D.A. stands for D.V. and R. So it sounds like madman is saying D.V. and R is erasing his weird pedophia. Uh, yeah. So anyway, Ava Chris responds their twins. So at that point is just masturbating, right? Uh, no. No. I mean, this should make anybody deeply uncomfortable. Stop it, Dipper. We shouldn't be doing this. Else, Wendy is, also, Wendy is waiting for you. And then, please, don't stop. Dude, what the fuck, bro? Sick. Jail? Yeah. Brother and sister want to make love. I don't say a dentist. No, no, no, no, no. Dennis Berger is clearly a fan of Shadman. How much Shadman art do you own Dennis Prager? What's your argument? That's what Chris. That's what Ava Chris said. What's your argument? That's what Chris said. What's your argument? That's what Chris said. What's your argument? That's what Chris said. It's incest. Wait, there's more. Oh, wait, is that the end of it? Hold on, I don't think so. I think I closed it and discussed early. Nope, that was all of it. So there's more here in a different link. The artist, Shadman, Drew, Kimster's eight-year-old daughter, here's Kim's tweets about it. Did he do that for any specific reason? Why did he target Kimster? You know, I don't know. Um, why? Besides the million dollars. Call them out or something. Um, Yeah, with Kim, it's, who knows. It's easy to assume that he hated him for any 1,000 different reasons. So YouTube drama, Kim, re, tweeted this, while there's a lot of transphobic bullshit that should be debunked, Chris Tyson was also a massive shadman fan, even commissioned art for him, which made a cameo and what a Mr. Beast videos. She is not as clean as a lot of y'all would like her to be. I think that's true. I think that that's true. We have to fight our biases here, guys, and be real that this is all coming together to be something really nasty. There's a really gross pattern happening here. Kim, quote, tweet this and say, Chris Tyson supported the cartoon CP artist, Chad Man, that drew my daughter at age eight in a sexual manner. This is a known fact, privately me and Chris Tyson even had a conversation about this roughly a month ago. It still upsets me. This is not misinformation. This is a fact. Oh, but because, oh, this put, okay, I see what's happening. This thread was removed by the mods of YouTube drama. Yeah. The top, the reason being, this is just misinformation. There's no evidence. She commissioned this piece. Oh, no. No, no. No, this person is, I don't know if they're being like intentionally obtuse or if they just don't understand the point, this is saying, I see there's no avid didn't necessarily commission but she shares how bought it right like what's the big fucking difference yeah, they're being ultimately fired that mod was being very like um technically a dantic yeah, it's like the the broader point completely stands but whatever. That wasn't even really the point of showing this. I just wanted to include Kim, you know, that this artist did that to Kim. We still weren't able to start fans here, but that is like completely disgusting. You know, is every right to be serious and haven't been dead up because of this. So it's a sweet, pretty fact. So I'm a huge, uh, Kim star. The story behind that is that someone on Tumblr asked Shadman to draw Keem stars young daughter if Donald Trump won the election and then when Donald Trump did win. They did. They celebrated. Got it. Oh, so Keem was just like a totally. I mean, yeah, it was just somebody trolling Keem. Yeah. Sounds like that's not willingly participating in that. That's disgusting. So there it is. Eva bought a piece of art from them and often replied to their tweets. Here's the art. By the way, we blocked it out, but this is the piece that we showed of the girl with the gun in her mouth saying, and this is the background of a Mr. Beast video. And I believe this is Chris's room. I don't think Jamie had it up. Chris? Yeah, I see what. Or Ava's tweet above it. Or Ava's room? Talks about it. This is coming from the guy who. So it's Chris or Ava's saying like this is coming from me who has a drawing in their living room. Oh, he's like, and I'm crazy. So listen to me. Yeah. It's okay. Ava Chris said this is coming from the guy who owns a Shad-based drawing and has it as a centerpiece in his living room. That is really And here it is. What are you doing? The receipts are here. Yeah. Now I know a lot of you a lot of people are going to use this as evidence to say like Mr. Beast and the crew knew about this. How much weight do you give that? I mean, it's in the video, it's on the wall. I mean, they at least knew that they were in the wall, you should. Also, it have to. Do you remember Turner, who called in one time a few years ago, who worked for Mr. Beast? The video editor. Yes, he's in chat. And I jotted down something that he had said that I wanted to read to you, just because I was like, oh, wow. Sure. It was Turner said, I'm just going to say this one more time. Back in 2018, she was always talking about discord servers of Lali in person. It was, they actually need help. So creepy. I believe that. Yeah, I'm not being able to. Like, that sadly adds up with everything. If you're a fan of Shadman, you're in the closer. Yep. You're in the culture. Okay. Well, if you're like an active fan of of Lollicon, you're just a pedophile. Like, I didn't even know how else to, I don't really have any way to sugarcoat that. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Like, that is just heinous shit. A pedophilic ideation at the very least. And especially if you're seeking it out in discord service, I'm sorry. That's not good. Well, also being in discord servers with children, it's just, anyway, you're slice it. This is, this is not good. This is not good. Quite bad. I don't even go so far as to say. Yeah. Let me hit this real fast. Hit that. Yeah, even these replies to Shadman on Twitter, like even those standing alone is so like promoting him and normalizing this shit because that's what these communities try to do is like, oh, yeah, this is it. This isn't it was normalized. This is in pedophile. Yeah, this is just drawing. It's absolutely normalized at the time, shit. It's like we just woke up all the time. Yeah. Realized with the hell. way to fuck up. Um, so I don't know, I don't know if I don't know how, uh, damning this is going to be for his friends, Jimmy and the crew. Um, but it's certainly getting messy now. Really messy. It is getting messy. And you know, I'm love to say this, but something did strike me a few minutes ago. Sonny V2 said Mr. Beast has a problem. Tony and Gay. And I don't endorse that whole video. There was a lot of ridiculous transphobia in that video and homophobia and all that. But. I mean, we spent like an hour making fun of Sonny. For the transphobia? I can explain that they are all these compression lines. Well, it's my mother said this year we're going to live in the maximum of Toyota. So, she was chosen between the Highlander, the Rapp4 or the Corolla, and I'm in charge of the Diversion. Diversion? 20 floaters of Flamingo and 100 floaters of Playa? Well, in the case of the perfect model to carry all the diversions in this summer at the maximum. Only the two of Juryo, Toyota, let's go together. El inventario can vary or visit your participant for more details. What are you a sonny? I'm just saying. Should we say sorry? Hold on. Oh, sonny. Like a partial look. I am absolutely, I'll have to watch that video, but there was a lot of like, it was a long time ago. No, no, no, no, no, no. I am not, I'm not going that far. We weren't criticizing him for the transphobia, the like absolute. Yeah. And again, if he's, and I'm not calling Ava, like, a groomer or whatever and he's not showing any evidence for it. Gay, I think you just turned a gay. I honestly haven't watched that video in a while. I mean, I haven't watched it since we watched it on the show. But I do think that we might owe him at least a partial sorry. Sorry. It's bit gay. Turn it on. Yeah. Um, turn it on. Yeah. He was saying that Eva was turning Carl Jacob's gay or something. Yeah, I don't remember what. But I remember being like, pretty clearly. Yeah, no, it twisted. I'm being tongue-in-cheek, obviously. And it wasn't just us. There was like, oh no, they're calling me Danny V2. No. Oh, you've got your busted. Oh, brand drama. Does anyone call you Danny? Huh? Does anyone call you Danny? Um, no. No. What do you parents call you? Dan Dan. Yeah. I've been Dan since I was really young. I guess when I was really young, I got called Danny a little bit, but I got locked in on Dan in like the second grade because I shit you not. I had five Daniels. Oh my goodness. In my class and a Danielle. Oh my God. We all we all. We all got divvyed up into Daniels, Danies and Danes with a last initial. I was always Dan S. I was like, I didn't know. I was always Dan S. I was like, I didn't know. That's what I got there were five fucking Daniels in my class. That's a lot. I don't know. I don't know. I guess Olivia L. I never ever was in any another looping with another Ethan never happened. It's not that common of the name for for age cohort. I don't know if I do any Ethan screwing up. I defted. He did. I only I've met only one other Ethan growing up and it was like wow look at up I Can't believe it my my mom my name was supposed to be Ethan before Wait, I don't know my dad's like now. We're not even a Ethan. What's his problem with Ethan? Nothing just my mom like the name Ethan your mom was right now I mean Zach works great. Yeah, you're very much a Zachary. No, and Ethan's a great name. Zach's a great name. It was supposed to be one of the best. I'm Ethan Bernstein at a heart doesn't sound too bad. No, not at all. But you're Zach a raya. There you go, man. She'll loan brother. She'll loan my brother. Um... Anyway, what's supposed to be Aburahman? Is it supposed to be what? No, I'm kidding. Aburahman, I just trying to think of the most Arab name I could think of. What is it? What was the name? Aburahman? Aburahman? Aburahman? Aburahman? Aburahman? Aburahman? What is the first name? Aburahman? Usually means father of... Aburahman? Is that what you said? Is that what you said? Aburahman? Oh, Aburahman? Yeah, close no. No, you're, you're, you're, you're, that's not your name. No, my run names up dollar. I met, I had class with one other up dollar, but he went, he let the teachers call him a dula and I was like, I hate up dollars like you because that's one of the main reasons I go by fucking AB. up you don't like to do a lot of that sense specific sound in English up like that that way they go to the Yeah, there's the you or something add dolla. I don't know or like yeah, or like a water boy came out when I was a kid So my teacher would read Abdullah they'd say Madula Abungada or Abdullah Abungada. Oh, yeah, I want to say Anyway, um Where are we so this is this one is uh... an unearthed clip of avocress i don't know that this one didn't really mean anything it's just kind of funny how bone headed is i i don't think it's relevant really at all not to this particular situation it is an extremely embarrassing clip is just really dumb by any way when you guys uh... recently i've been here as you go and you guys uh... recently i've been hearing about the genet mucurti the link of her photo. What the story is, she's seen pictures to her boyfriend, her now ex-boyfriend, and he leaked them out, and she is a very popular Nickelodeon star on the show, Icarly, and obviously is the pulling of the show. It'll probably be taking off the air. Signal well. You'll probably see the photos get taken down at some point and I maybe to more because Nickelodeon has that kind of power. But the links in the description if you want to see them on Nickelodeon, the powerful. They control it. They got that kind of power. But again, all you can. It's like a luminality. Power. I don't know what to do. Some people go to look at somebody else's private business, but I know that You know, people might want to see him, so they're fucking weird. That is such a weird sentence. Like, why didn't he hold on to it? Roll it back. This is very correct. We got to break this down. This is a crazy sentence. Let me just play it out because I know here at all. I'm not endorsing people to go look at somebody else's private business, but I know that, you know, people might want to see him, so they're there if you want it. First of all, what I have to say is that I don't want to, I don't endorse anybody, any end to private business. Other people's private business. But anyways, links in the description box. What do you do with it? But I saw them and they were 10 out of 10. It's like crazy. Where does this go? I'm not endorsing links in the description. It gets even crazy if you watch the rest. The whole rest of this clip is, I'm talking about how bad revenge porn is. Like, why is the link in the description? It's from their girlfriend, and I... The cognitiveness of that girl kills herself. It's a tragic story. Everybody calls the guy bully. But yeah, when people like Perez Hilton do it, it's considered entertainment. So, again, I have to think about where the writing wrong is, really. And I think it's all wrong. I mean, it's pretty clear for us. He's the fucking morpies of revenge porn. He's like, all I'm offering you is a choice. I'm going to link and see how far the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit hold the rabbit Pretty interesting approach there to the news. Options are good. This is so fucking free will is. Why you know, free will defines who we are as people. That's what sets us apart. And he understands that. He says, you make the choice. Free will is yours. I only offer the choice. I could not believe that one. Like, and obviously it's, you know, it's not directly tied to any of this other walley underage stuff. But it's just, I don't know. It's just being very dumb. Yeah, it's just very dumb. It wants to make his living. It's up to him. You decide if it's moral or if it's a moral. Thanks for watching guys. Stay awesome. Stay awesome. I don't see why people think that that is somehow worse than the shit that we've already seen though. It just seems like he's an idiot. I mean, it is fucked up. Yeah, you definitely should not share a revenge for him, right? And it's weird or two because they seem to be aware of that. But then they're doing it anyways. So I don't really know what that speech is. He looks, honestly, I can be stupid. I can write that off, it's just being a bonehead. But again, it doesn't matter because I just saw him in a room full of kids talking about he wants to come in an egg and fucking eat it. Yeah, that's that one's so on and so far. He looks mad so cut cut to Ethan shot Does anybody else see this where if you if you tilt him up he's got a smiley face with a little nose But when he's tilted down it looks like he's got a double chin and he's pissed off It's like a little frowny face. I don't want that. I want him looking happy. Okay. I like to see the neck beard too. It's not the same without it. Right. See people saying Jeanette was a minor for that revenge. I my understanding was that that it was leaks of her as an adult. Um, not that that's any better, but that it was not underage news. Uh, well, if that's true. Olivia is very fine there right now. If he was sharing the news of a minor, then that would obviously be relevant. And I've seen people saying that, but I saw others clarifying that this was that this leak was when she was an adult. It wasn't when she was on a little kid on the show. But Olivia is back in that up right now. I think we would have known that seems like a, anyway, okay. Is it, yeah, I mean, that would be a way bigger deal. It's, um, whatever. So moving on here, um, find, find where we are. Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Somebody believes who have found Eva Chris' old Reddit account. And you know, whenever I hear that, I go, ooh, this is gonna be bad. Now let's take a look at Eva Chris' allegedly. old Reddit account. Now how do we know that this is allegedly there. So it is all just inference. I don't know. I don't think it's been confirmed. However, uh, the account on Reddit was Tyson Boy 34, uh, which was in reference to rule 34 stuff and go ahead. You have something. I'll type it. And, um, Ava at one point did use that name on other platforms and additionally there were comments that were dug up on this account that though weren't super specific they were making reference to like where they live and it was the same area that Ava lived at the time and so there's strong correlation between Ava and this account. Um, and also the subject matter of it is also relevant to this conversation. Jeanette was 22 in the photos apparently, so. Okay, there you go, whatever. Not that it makes it. It's not fucked up. It's just whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Um, she did play a teenager. One of this happening. Right. All the probably were the confusion. No worries. I thought her name was Melissa McCartney. There's one. There's one. There's one. There's one. Yeah. You don't want to know what I found. Oh no. Why are there news of Melissa McCartney? I don't think they're real. But they're not. Not that close to them. Oh yeah, that was her. I look good. Um, Nate sent me a little update about the sunny video. Dan, this goes directly to your claims that Sonny is a saint and he's right. And we're not saying that. I did not say that. I that put like 50 caveats on there. The core of Sonny's video was him highlighting all the transfer. He was basically, um, raising all the transphobic comics comments when Ava Chris came out as trans. And basically, he, his son he was showing all these transphobic comments and saying that Ava coming out would kill the Mr. Beast channel, which is obviously crazy hysteria. Yeah. Thank you. Don't endorse that part. Thank you. Just to be clear. I know you're, I know you, I know you're. Dan is a wolf Danny V2 Danny V2. He's a walking shout out to Dan. Oh, thank you. So yeah, I think when I saw the evidence I was like that's that's him. It's got the same name as a public, was he had a public account, by the way, believe it was a twitch account. It seemed streamed under the name, Tyson Boy 34. I saw a YouTube account, too, with like a old log of him from 10 years ago. So other social media platforms associated with the same name, the details on the account, talking about living in North Carolina, right? That's where I was from. So we're saying it adds up. It adds up. And as we're about to see from the messages, it correlates to some of the tweets that we were looking at earlier as well. So yeah, it's almost certainly, I would say him and the only reason I'm hedging that is because I don't want to get sued. Is that, that's fair, you know. uh... so here is this is from for channel looks like right or is this the four trans subreddit so it is it's this was a reddit accounts of all these are reddit posts it's just that particular board is made to look like fortune okay so here is a comment from Tyson boy thirty four and i'm gonna give a little bit of a trigger warning because this is i'm seeing really gross Why the fuck would you use your VR headset for anything other than 3D Lolly Gang rape porn? I believe video games, I'm mine. Yeah, that's why, I mean, I thought that's why most people use it. Eat Sabre? No, I'm trying to be Sabre. Fuck yeah. I'm gonna write that. How could you write that out? Okay, here's more from Reddit, Tyson Boy 32, but You can still get teen love, 14 year olds always stay 14. I don't like that. What does that even mean? No, they don't. True. You have a good point, they don't. No, they age like everyone else. I feel like that quote is like slightly reminiscent of like, is it Matthew McConaughey's life? We get older high school girls stay the same. Right, yeah. It takes like that to me. Yeah, I think he was trying to do that joke. Unless they go to Neverland. So true. Not the ranch, but the fantasy land where the kids don't grow up. No, no, no. No, no, no. I know about it. No, fucking no. Bonus edit, the Tyson boy 34 also talks about North Carolina age of consent laws in a comment below. The North Carolina, the rule is if the minor is 16 or 17, then the other person has to be within five years. That's a big grace for age gap. But then his age, so a 16-year-old can be with a 21-year-old at the highest, but then once you turn 18, it doesn't matter. If a grew up in North Carolina, there's a lot of things here overlapping to substantiate that this is A of his old-rated account, right? I guess this is some of the bread crumbs of evidence. Right, okay, and I forgot about this, but they mentioned having a dog and it's the same name as a dog that if. So somebody asks, is there any confirmation? This is actually Tyson Boy, and the response is, yes, so some personal slew thing I've come across this tick-tock post. by Ava and her dog chief. On the Chris meme, the meme God account. Tyson Boy 34 account had made posts on awe about a dog they got a few years earlier, also called chief. Ava's old YouTube account was called Tyson Boy 34. I also believe her twitch account now since deleted was also called Tyson Boy 34 judging by how there are dead links to that channel all referring to Ava on Twitter. For instance, lava the supposed group minor according to the exposed video added at Tyson boy 34 switch down back in 2016 here so that's okay so there's there's these two ones which are both really gross especially in considered in once again broader picture putting it all together And this happened yesterday pretty quickly after I started hearing about this story, is that Ava is the people got what they wanted. Ava is stepping away from Mr. B. So though this time I can't say that. Sounds like a good call. Justified. Yeah. At the end of the day, I'm afraid to say, You gotta go. You gotta go. You gotta go. You gotta get off the internet. Oh, Jesus. What should he be able to stay Jason? Oh, go. He wants him to go. Jason wants you to go. She should stay. I'm sorry. Wait, why do I see Harris Buttigieg trending? Did she announce him as VP or the people just...simping? I thought I'd seen him. I haven't heard anything. Oh, we got the Harris laughing. I think you just fell out of a hole in that tree. You don't exist. In the context of all of which you've lived, let's come for you. Okay, I'm getting distracted. So here is Ava's apology once it was announced that she'll be stepping away. And honestly, there's a lot, I think that could be apologized for or explained by Ava. And the statement offered was pretty slim. I'll read it to you. I would like to apologize for any of my past behavior, or comments if it hurt or offended anyone. That's like, apology one of one is you don't say to the if. See Kyle in this Seattle would not be impressed. He would not, he would not. See Kyle. Why even add that though? I would like to apologize for any of my past behavior comments. Period. Because this this way basically what this means is when someone writes if it offended you means that I didn't think it was offensive. Right. But if it upset you, then, you know, sorry about that. So, not good. It was not my intent. Seeing recent events, we've mutually decided it's best I permanently sip away from all things Mr. Beast and social media to focus on my family and mental health. She continues. I want to add, I never groomed anyone the person who gets brought up in these accusations. Lava has vocally supported that they are false. That's true, although there's another one that's not being mentioned. Yeah. Having said that, I humbly apologize to anyone I have hurt. with my unacceptable social media posts, past action, and to those who may feel betrayed by how I used to act online. To lump these two factors together to create an error that my behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen. I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I can agree with the on that one, man. Well, I think I mean, obviously we're coming down on the side of what she did was very bad and very wrong. Let me finish. So there's one more sentence. And the past years, I have learned that my old humor is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself. So for me, it's the the DM that she sent the 13 year old it's the chat room with the coming in the egg comment it's the combined with the fascination with lolly is in my opinion coming close enough to like groomy type of behavior that I disagree I think that be a little more honest with herself about what actually I think characterizing it as grooming is fair after everything that we've seen especially like love pointed out with just the sharing the the private messages from other big creators and stuff I mean this is all very you know with somebody who's 13, 14 years old, it's very manipulative. Yeah. Yeah. It's not, it's not cool. And I don't like, I don't like to overuse that word grooming. I feel like it gets overused, but in this case, I think. And when you include the sexual jokes and everything, it's definitely, it's not good. It's not good. Let's see here a former Mr. Beast employee named Dawson posted this cryptic video to Twitter saying that Ava is just the tip of the iceberg. Let's take a look. I worked for Mr. Beast. Ava Chris Tyson is the tip of the iceberg. We can't play the music, obviously. It didn't get clean. That never gets clean. I checked that. I don't know. That one never got claimed. I thought I did it. The whole song did, but like, little clips of it, never. I think I claimed. We play it all the time on the show. Well, I play it some bit. But it's so small. It's just as a minor. Well, this is small too. It only plays for like this specific video. I checked it. There was no claim on it. Really? Yeah. I don't know. Well, if it gets claimed, we can just. The music is only at the very beginning. Yeah, whatever. It's like the number one song in the world for like, I mean, shit. Oh, yeah, that wasn't a lot. I know it's sad Mr. B studio right now. Here's a cornfield. I'll explain that tomorrow. Oh, the what's in the cornfield, bro? It's supposed to be a reference to that to the Kendrick and Drake cryptic stuff. I don't think so. I assume the beginning. The beginning was, but I don't think the cornfield. Yo, something went down in the cornfield. Children of the corn, man. I was thinking was that the reference that he was saying? That's what I thought. Children of the corn? Yeah. Oh, no, not children of the corn. No, not that. No, not that. I just meant Kendrick stuff. Well, we'll see. I mean, apparently he shows this. He's like, you know, is there an FBI raid going on? What's happening? My name is Dawson. I worked at Mr. Beast from February to May of this year, 2024. Chris is the tip of the iceberg. And when Jake the Viking says, Mr. Beast knew, yeah, Mr. Beast knew. I heard many times that Eva, Chris Tyson, is a major liability, but they can't get rid of her because she's already through an legal action and she knows too much. And when all this information comes out about everything that she knew, everything other people know, I promise you on everything Mr. Beast has done. Amazon. Oh, shut up. Did you get your money back? Get your money back. What does that mean Amazon get your own? Oh, cause they've licensed them to make that big show. Yep. Okay, so obviously this guy's all talk at the moment. This guy is confirmed, works for Mr. Beast. We confirmed through our own investigatory channels. Yes, we did and separately came started as well. So we've got two confirmations. so but i mean he's making big claims that there's it is interesting if if they tried to fire ava and then she threatened legal action that's pretty you that would be look really bad i mean that might exonerate jimmy to some degree if ava was like exerting legal Yeah, if they made an effort to get rid of her after being made aware of this, that certainly makes the world better. What do you mean? What grounds for lawsuit discrimination against long-fledged rumors, discriminated? No, back when I don't know, but like if she wanted to, she could definitely Uh, good try. Yeah. Yeah, wrongful termination for discrimination. You're saying if they fired her because she's talking. No, this is no, he's talking about like back when all the sunny D shit started happening. Oh, people are saying. Yeah. Yeah. It was funny delay. Whatever. When she was, people were shitting on her for being trans, essentially. And lots of people were being like, Mr. B's got a dropper. Yeah, okay. I'm just understood. Yeah, obviously if Mr. Beast fired her for being trans or coming out. But I don't know if he knew more, right? Uh-huh. I don't know. God, I hope he didn't. Sounds like he did maybe. I have a minimum Mr. Beast knew that she was in Dolali. Come on. Let's be real. I mean, it was on the wall. Yeah, it was on the wall. Exactly. She went around the end of the video. I saw this picture on Twitter all like close friends. I saw this picture on Twitter that I just sent. It's supposedly Mr. Beast isn't it? Let me see. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Hang on, I'm pulling it up. Hold on. First of all, we need a dent. Okay. Is this you, Dan? Or what? The fuck, dude. Okay. Well, I understand that you think, oh, no, they found my ult. Dan, he beat me. My ult with 4 million subs, right? Yeah. It was on the ground. Man, why do you have to blow it up like that? So where's Jimmy? You see Jimmy in here somewhere? But he has the orange hood on. Oh, shit, that's Jimmy. This was so fucking weird as Twin Peaks looking shit every last week. This was so, yeah. I'm unexplainable. I'm sorry. So bizarre. So, I mean, I do think it's safe to assume that Jimmy and the gang knew to some degree that He was in the lawly. Do you think that this warrants some kind of response from Jimmy, some kind of acknowledgement, or should he just keep rolling? Well, as of right now, there isn't any specific accusation against Jimmy. Just that he knew other than, yeah. But again, I mean, no way, it gets weird because it's like, I mean, I think we can all agree that this is like any excuseable behavior, but I don't think fell out already. but you know like new what that he had like that he was in the lolly like that's like roast but I mean it's not a crime right like what what is it that he's covering up now if he if he knew if mr. Beast knew that he was regularly having sexual explicit conversation with highly doubt for the right Right, which that probably was happening away from Jimmy. For sure. I think I would highly doubt that Jimmy had any knowledge of the DMs or the Discord server or anything like that. I think the extent of Jimmy's knowledge about it if I had the guess was just that like he saw there was Lawley porn on the wall and he probably knew because they've been best friends for so long that he's into that shit. He seemed pretty open about it. Right. Read about it. Regularly evidently yeah, so I mean Yeah, so I don't know does this beast have to say yeah, I mean, it's in a weird gray zone there, you know I mean ultimately it's like People around you can do fucked up shit and it's not always easy to Do the right it's not always easy to like do the right thing Sometimes doing the right thing isn't always exactly clear. Ultimately, Jimmy didn't do anything. Whatever terrible things that we know we're done, we're done by Ava, right? And so, I don't know. It's definitely a tough spot to be in for Beast. Not sure what he'll do there. He might make an apology for Cody Co. Cody Coz not I told you he's not gonna say anything by the way he's he's gone yeah I think so too he's gone oh gone gone I don't I don't think it's a b it's just so here's another I don't this is totally unrelated but this came up and uh... how old was beast in this one what year was this how old was he let's get the contacts where we run it Are we talking about here? Oh, you don't know about that baby thing yeah Beast made a comment about and he did's Bad baby So here it is he did a podcast with these guys Bad baby at the time I guess was 14 that he enjoys the cash-me-out-side girl. I think she's funny, so let's just show us what you want to put your dick in it. I mean, that's what they're trying to enjoy it. I was only wanting someone to put in your dick with someone. It was a whole different story. Yeah. Yeah. I was like 14 years old. I was like 14 years old. And he did say that he enjoys actually. That's actually crazy. He did not say that for the record, although that that entire conversation absolutely needs to be. That's just boys being boys up dog. She was 14. then it would be in 2017 2018 which makes Jimmy drum roll please 20 so that would make Jimmy send anybody calculating I'm not in 2018 how old was Jimmy in 2018 he was about 20 he was 20 and she was 14 which you put your dick in her already then Jimmy be step-by-one You know, I was watching this last night. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Nate. Let's... I'll tell you about it. Thank you. I was watching on this last night and I turned it yellow and I said, dude, all I ever did was say the N-word. Bro... No. Nope. Skip. Nope. Nope. Nope. I wonder. No, that's funny. Anyways. I mean, okay. Come on. That's fucking funny, guys. What's going on here? That was a funny joke. I missed it. What? I missed it, unfortunately. You guys, that's a good bit. The joke is that saying the end word is a really bad thing. Yeah, I got it. You know, but you could, I, okay. You guys are killing comedy, man. I'll see you at the music video. It's not that good a joke. It is though. No. It is a good joke. I disagree. Let's do a whole series of agree. No. Sure. Happily. Let's throw it to the audience. Let's do a whole. I'll see you at the music video. What do you think? It was funny or it was cringe. I thought you're going to button that people saw me like indicate no me to that was come on. I'm not saying it was I'm the joke is that saying that anyone was bad. It was a horrible thing.

It's so bad. So true. I went into that being like, when I first went into the story, I really wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to Ava. but it became increasingly clear that that was not deserving of that yeah which is such a bummer oh there's something here not a bomb hopefully oh that's not a bomb that's on badass yeah what is this it's got cookies What is the big thing? Oh, all kinds of chocolates, artists and chocolates. What the fuck? Oh, I know what that is. What's flowers and Beverly Hills? What is that? That's a very nice, very beautiful.

Thank you for making a little guy feel important. You are all very special. Love you Jim Bell. This I think it's a delayed gift on behalf of from the Greek? Yeah, he wanted to really come to the Greek, and we let him do a sting on stage there. That scared me. I thought that was going to lead into, I'm dying. You thought it'd be what?

You saw he canceled the show. uh... for the king yeah canceled on the king man yeah i don't know what's real anymore like i don't know does he actually believe that i can't tell i can't tell here but i don't know i don't think he's in on it um... the key genuinely thought he was invited to bucky i did start to have some doubts when we talked to him the other day like i fully thought he was in on the joke but the way he was he's being so serious he was being very serious i don't know if he's that is good of an actor i think he's not that good of a comedian to be frank I don't know.

Arrowing cookies. Mexican shortbread. Okay, gluten-free apparently. Wow. For my gluten-sensitive legends, more cookies. It's a fancy. I'm fine, Paris. I text Jimmy the other day because I actually did feel bad that he took that tumble and he said he's doing all right. Oh, that's- He actually seemed like he really was down and out. Yeah. His shoulder looked very swollen to me when he was showing us right here. Honestly, I'll be honest. I didn't really look like much. I'm not saying he's injured. I don't see why he would. But it just, it was funny because it, I was expecting it to look worse. Oh, there's a, it came with a real golden plate, you guys. Whoa. Who's in, who needs it? Solid gold. I need that. It's all gold. You can have it. Look at that. Thank you. Who wants some cookies and chocolate? Oh, good cookie. Come grab. Oh, my hungry. Yeah, me too. I'm excited to say everyone cook you.

You're amazing, Nate. Got it out. Great. He's been doing a good job. Everyone. Everyone. That's my favorite. That's perfect. Everyone. You were eating donuts? A little bit to that. Probably snacked, damn. I mean, I can. You want me to? We also have the first minute of that Jimbo video. Yeah, both. Speaking of Jimmy and the mystery surrounding him, there's something else that has me absolutely mystified. I don't understand what's happened. There is, posted by a new channel like, on good subs videos like 200 views, show all from our subreddit. The Jelmo show, number one. The second coming of Jimmy Lee, somebody, added together an hour-long episode, 50-minute episode, of what can only be described as a fever dream of epic proportion. It is phenomenal. It's well-edited, it's original. Clearly, whoever put together his talented and very funny. So good. And I'm just fucking confused as shit. Like, is Jimmy involved in this? Did you ask him maybe? He's, he's the one that sent it to me. Oh, no, I forgot. I was installed. There's no who made it. Let me ask him. I, I, I honestly believe that a adult swim would buy this. This is the type of shit that I like, would die to see an adult swim at 3 a.m. Let me play it for you guys. My favorite part of the beginning gets claimed, though. Really ashamed. My pork is this way. Come on. Come on. Come on, my love. Oh shit. It's scared me to other. I'm scared. My hands are where we have to stop. I'm just muted them. So here you wakes up in the afterlife.

You're making a spectacle of yourself. He gives her painting that one, which is so chill. Wait, this is the same thing the guy says. It's a lot funnier. You know? Twelve months. Oh, this part of... If it's last two of two, I mean, it's never last night. Come quick. Take your glasses off. You're making a spectacle of yourself. Oh, no, I can't. I can't do this. I can't do it. You're out. You're out. Go die again. I quit. I quit. I quit. You're making a spectacle. The drill mode fell. The second coming and demulated. Coming up on the drill mode show. We're filming and we're going to go in like 20 minutes. What's wrong? Don't even joke. Trump was shot. You want to go in here, get some pot? We'll buy you some pot? What do you want? Oh, shit. This to be made on Melrose. Yeah. Now this appears to be footage shot exclusively for this piece, because I have not seen this footage anywhere else. Yeah. I'm convinced this is a whole production. He's. Yeah. He's. How the fuck, like I can't, your heart is fine. Good people and Jimmy's just accidentally finding like some kind of like creative genius. How's that possible? You're working a test on the mics testing one two. Even this angle is so good. Oh, that didn't get clamped that part. No, just the first minute. All right, go back. Let's just go right to Washington Square Park. Is it this way? Whoever added this together. You know, you know, you know, they show well enough to know you can't use some people. Damn, play a loser. Jersey at Lord New York City. I'm all hidden down the Washington Square Park right now. It was two. It was under a minute so that it doesn't let you post it. Let's do it again. Jimmy. Oh, that sounds. Yeah, that sounds like the gentleman that we brought with him to live show. There was a younger guy he brought with him to a live show. I think that's him. It sounded like his voice. The guy that was taking videos of him. I got to talk to him, forget you and me. Bam. Andre, you're now. Was it a decent Instagram club? Yeah, I'm just trying to. That's one of his social media people. I don't think he pays her. Hell no. She did. I'm serious. Is she dead? Gerald, I'm not joking. Yeah. You just said it. It is Gerald. That's Superman's dad. It is also the person that won the Green Screen Competition. I thought I recognized that editing style. Yeah. Yeah. This now makes a lot more sense to me. So Jimmy reached out to this person, or probably the other way around. Yeah, probably the other way around. Holy fuck. That's sick. Yeah. I wonder if Jimmy paid him for this. He better out, right? This doesn't seem like it's a Jimmy project. It was posted, like, what channel is this on? It's the Jolmo show channel, brand new. Okay. Well, I guess maybe it's some sort of collaboration, yeah. I got captivated. I got lost in it. I haven't watched the whole 50 minutes, but I absolutely want to. Um, which I'll do later tonight. Let's see. Maybe members? Oh, there was wait hold on. This part was really funny when he was reading comments to people I died. It was just insane. He's in the park. And I don't know where he's getting this, I guess social media. Oh shit. The world's most stupid person on a subject next to the world's most educated person on the subject. And would, to take birth, suffer the fool. And so I created this character, Ali G, it's been based on an early version of a character that I'd come up with. or thousands of fans. I mean, I cannot get over the turnout. Today, this is this is crazy. The turnout for us. Thank you. Nice to meet you. All right. We have a fan come in here. Young buck with your name. I'm worried. All right. All right. Ten of flight? Ten of flying New Jersey. So what brought you out? Is that my order? This could be my water. Hold on. I'll leave a comment. I'll take some on the street, okay? Sure. Yeah, the second. Jack Lewis live at the ex echo plosh. I'll leave August second. Don't miss out. I don't hear you out. That's not the right thing. How epic you back guy was there, is that? Lovely weather we're having. He randomly did it. Lovely weather we're having. Just lovely weather we're having. Say the end word Welcome to chillies Welcome to chillies What's the gay one? Oh This fight man Pride month is over you guys need to leave Okay I think there's something interesting going on here where if somebody with a like a comedic sense can put him out if he can be directed and controlled yeah and collaboration with somebody that knows what they're doing It could potentially be something. This could make him famous. That's a good point because like Tiger King, for example, there were so many Tiger King documentaries prior that were just shit and it wasn't that interesting. But then the new one, the way that I put it together was just art. So I'll never forget. Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David were good friends. Larry David was not a successful comedian but he was very funny. One day he went to Jerry's girlfriend's birthday party and he wrote jokes for her birthday and everyone's like, I tell the jokes and he's like, I don't want him and then Jerry's like, I'll read him. Jerry read Larry's jokes and it killed Jerry doing Larry's jokes great. That's what it's happening here. Jimmy filtered is an adult swim 3 a.m. classic. Yeah. It is funny now. Let's get forward. I was thinking tomorrow we could watch the whole thing. What do you guys think about that? Yeah. I don't remember stream. Sure. But I definitely, so we'll do that. But I recommend checking it out. This is phenomenal. The Joe Moche. Oh. So we'll see what happens here. I'm very curious. You know? Let's see. If I may contest, if we're going to do the one section that I talked about in discord, I think we should do that now because there's going to be developments while we're live. Oh, the big stuff. So yeah, so there's a big update on the low cow stuff. is getting so far out of control. I'm surprised Keemsters with his history with people unaliving is not being more careful because I was watching this episode and I was starting to get genuinely worried about buggy and not only that thoroughly disgusted by the mean it's mean girl behavior by Moodahar. means star and the other guy on there just relentless bowling to the point where I just it's not funny or interesting it's just feels I told you it's feel bad TV you know they say feel good TV feel bad TV sounds like The law cow podcast may have jumped the shark. Yeah. You even said that last time. You said peaked. It had peaked and you should retire it and maybe you're right because it sounded like you're out now. It's getting hard to watch and I frankly feel bad for Boogie, which I didn't think was possible at this point. And you're manipulating, you're manipulating. And specifically, Moodahar was really gross. Like I know they don't like each other, but these people are fucked in the head. Buggy is very clearly not okay. And now Kim starts saying, if you want to get back on the show, you have to tattoo liar on your face. Yeah, and just to clarify, this is now is from today's live that starts in an hour. Well, that's not a real tattoo, but It might become one. Well, so at the time, it seemed like he was going to do it. He called it. He called it a place and made a appointment like immediately. He just seems really out of it. The part that really just disgusted me was they were picking apart. Buggies says that he was abused by his parents. And they were just, they were picking it apart. in a way that was like, so fucking grossed. And just so unnecessary. Yeah. That I was repulsed, frankly. And I am not team a loyal cow anymore. Oh, wow. This is huge. Yeah. From the beginning of the episode, he was saying he did not want to talk about this. Like, did not want to talk about it. And they just kept going. He didn't want to talk about his childhood. abuse specifically involving his other family members his brother and sister and they kept putting them up to talk they actually were still putting them up to talking about it um... i have some time stamps let's see uh... came up this part actually this is the most important part uh... all things aside come on sorry the link keeps crashing Okay. Can you see my screen? What? Can you see my screen of my laptop? No. Can we only see what's up? It's just giving me this. I can't play it. Oh. Well, let me come over there and fix it. Why don't you, um, read on. That weird. Well, here and then. In the meantime, I'll show you the Instagram story I made about it. Here. Page not found this happening. I think we've been hacked. I think we're hacked. I think we have been hacked. The cyber police did. Why? Go ahead. Dan literally scares technology like I'll be working on something. I can't figure it out Dan walks up and it works on the first try. It's kind of amazing. It's sort of like the opposite of Ethan's power. But he can just walks up and it stops working. You need Yang right here. Darkness and light. I can't think of any other comparisons. Good job, Nate on the little DVD logo. Nate was working on that. Yeah, it's very good. Yesterday. And it's having trouble here. Oh shit, I jinxed him. We're switching accounts. Help. He's slamming the space bar. Yeah, I got something cool to show you guys. Go ahead and eat, switch to me. Okay, see this little thing? I forget the name, but... You could put like whatever you want on there, and there's like fan made ones. So like I looked up H3, and there was like, there was a bunch of H3 ones. There was none of me. I'm not mad at it, but, okay. But here I'll show you. Just like I've H3, on the app, hit Apply, and it should work right now. There it goes. Very cool. Amazing. I'll find out the name if any of you are interested. I saw some people asking last time. I got you watching this one. This one is me, my buddy, love. Back when he was on love but and he was hungry and he wasn't in the studio and we were taste testing something and he couldn't eat it so I fed it to himself. I wish that was right now. There you go. I'll feed you right now. I own a future chip. I only take it right on my chest. Yeah, you mentioned that, true. There's literally every cast member on your except me. Okay. Okay, let me try it. Now let me try clicking the timestamp. I'm going to give that. Oh, you know that one was just mean you. We might be in business here. Literally. Nate does the thing ever hit the corner. My learns. Oh, it's going. It's going. It's going. It's going. It's going. Oh, oh. Well, okay. This way off. Oh, it's doing it again. How weird. It's not letting us watch it. I'm very bizarre. Is that? So it never hits you. I can tell you. It is, uh... Wait, wait, wait. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. That's good, thank you. You all right, Zack? No, I'm just, I want the thing to hit the corner. Oh, I see, I see. Thank you. It's coming. Wait, this is it, this is it. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no You said the time's up was what? This shit is kind of nutty. $59.53. It's shortly after. Oh, it did happen in the midst of a really nutty. Yeah, that's why. So here, I'm gonna play it and excuse me. Just crazy output. Oh, I understand. I understand. I'm quite aware. Okay, well, you're on here to have a conversation. You know, it's weird. Wings of redemption was the only one among them that had some level of like decency. Yeah, I don't know about his history is, but throughout this whole saga, he's always struck me. I don't know. I don't blame you for not catching it. Just watching it once, but being someone who watched it multiple times, he definitely makes a lot of fucked up comments. He does try to defend him in a few places. He was defending him. His thoughts like, when the team was like, Boogie's like, I have no money to my name. And things starts like, Send donate $3,000. Yeah, that parts. I remember that. I'll send you back your play button and he's like, okay, he has no money. He has no money. And they were like urging him all three of those. guys were like donate it, do it. Like they want him destitute and bro. Yeah, and he said that that gold play button, but they don't make anymore. It's like his prize possession. Like he loves it so much. And so he sent it to team to sell the charity and team was kind of like, I don't know. I collect play buttons. Maybe I'll just keep it. So he lied to him. Yeah, sir. He was kind of trolling him a little bit. Yeah. He also manipulated him to sell shares in the show to Kim for like an insanely discounted amount. I think he paid him, like, it sounds like a few thousand dollars for it. And then, uh, Boogie was talking about it. He's like, I feel like I got scammed and Kim goes, yeah, you get scammed. Get mad. And he played the duty to do. Somebody. I have the time stamp in here. But anyway, here's this part. This is my favorite part. about the stuff, not fucking, I don't fucking, I don't fucking show me a dick in pornography, like somebody else else is going to go back to it. Come on, what is this? What the fuck is this? Bro, this is what I was dealing with last time in the fucking phone bro, like honestly stop it, fucking stop it. It's like, you have to go there so you can play the picture. I was watching this with you and I said, what the fuck was that? Did he just have pain? Like I genuinely. It looks like a freeze bottle. I had to go back and watch it a few times. I just didn't get it. I made it into a story about it, but I don't know why. Oh, is it a link? Why isn't it showing that I just linked not working? It's weird. Let me try to open it and cug me to it. Oh, it's not working for me now either. What's that about? Why would someone, is it a link to Instagram? It's a Reddit link. So why would that get? Because it's someone just reposted your story. Let me, I mean, I see when I search Reddit, let me send it to you and discord. Is it just the same, but? I think Reddit is dumb. We have a more weird outage. It's like mega dumb. Okay, I'll send you the Instagram, then. Sorry about that. The internet is crashing. Absolutely. So here, okay. So here's a direct link to this story. Does that work? Do you send me a link? Oh, I guess it does work. Okay, what the fuck is he huffing? What is this? What is this? What is this? What the fuck was that? Did he just half fucking paint? Like, what was that? I don't know, man, but it weirded me out, and, uh, well, I've been under a lot of stress. This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. It's a so dystopian. Did he run out of vape juice? Is that what it was? And he just needed something? I think he's bathing too much, just putting oxygen in there. Oh, yeah. That thing felt nice when I tried it earlier. It just put like air. Dude, Olivia, that fucking hit it like, there's no tomorrow. She was like a bomb room for Olivia. It was so nice. Bro, this oxygen is insanely good. I get why I came to do it. So this is oxygen. What are you getting from your dinner? It's for breathing. That's what I hear, yeah. I don't know if you know this, but oxygen is actually free. One of the few themes that we get for free. Yeah, but it's not pure, dude. You don't have to buy it. I'm pure. According to this, it's not even, it's a 95% pure, it's not even a 100%. Wait, sorry. What's in that 5%? I don't know, it says boost, it's just air. Well, general, what is that mean? General air is less than 95% oxygen. It says booze, oxygen is 95% pure substance oxygen for all natural respiratory support. Oxygen is the most important and immediate fuel source for the body and mind. Is it a fuel source? I don't think so. It's used as like a mechanism for distributing nutrients, I thought. Is oxygen used as fuel in the body? Well, I mean, you need it. You need oxygen for a fire. This says it's not a fuel, it's an oxidizer. Yeah, it's not a fuel in the body. Certainly, you can. Certainly, you can. It's certainly the body needs oxygen. Fuel compounds. That's a fact. That's a fact. I don't think you can overdose on oxygen. Really? Because normal air is like, when you get to a normal air is like, 17% oxygen. Right? Yeah, but I think astronauts breathe pure oxygen and stuff. And they do. I don't know. I love that the bottle says no. Oxygen gas is essentially weightless. Full pressurized can is very light. Letting you know it's not an empty can. It feels empty, but they say you can get a 100 boost of one second in hails. Yeah, that's good air. How do you? That's good air right there girl. There is a such thing as oxygen toxicity. I'll meet you there then. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I'll figure out a way to abuse this shit. No, for real. You give me oxygen, I'll abuse it. So anyway, that was my favorite thing, and thank you to AB who ran out in the middle of the night to grab these from CVS or some shit. I couldn't believe the head of them in stock. I had to say to believe it. I'm sure it cost me what they were. I'm sure it cost. It was 15 for two. That's $15. That's a hundred. That's a hundred. That's a hundred hit. And if pure if air if room air is only 15% pro, that's essentially you're getting like five or six six puffs of normal air for the price of one. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, it's good. It's done the math efficient. Stop. You're coming right now. It's nice. I'm pulling nuts. I don't have a side of your mouth. I should have so good right now. Definitely. Oh my god. I'm fucking, I'm buzzing right now. Oh shit. Rhett and Link uploaded video testing this just as he said. They have a bunch of different flavors. Oh, I need flavor to air, baby. Okay, they did have different flavors. I mean, CBS only had this, but I did see on the website there was more flavors. The only flavor of air, I've tasted so far as pollution and smoke. Let's see people saying it's a good tool for quitting vaping. I think that's interesting because vaping is already theoretically a tool for quitting smoking. Yeah. So, do you just keep passing the addiction? You got to get into these air can. What do you do at that point? It's an ancient paradox. You start just putting on a mask to give the feeling of the air can on your face, but without the oxygen. Here's the stitch though. If it helps you quit vaping, This is more embarrassing, more healthy. I feel like you're holding a can with you. It's much less embarrassing just don't you? Absolutely not. This is way more embarrassing and weird. That's what I'm saying. I feel like there's a shot someone might like. It's like blue velvet. Maybe being addicted to nicotine is worth it. Do you guys remember in space balls when Mel Brooks opens up the canned air? He like, yeah, right. Because they're running out of the bottle and sell oxygen on the real. That is real. It's becoming real. Look, it's like Dennis Hopper. Remember this? You're seeing this movie? Yeah, Blue Velvet. Yeah. But he's, he's Huffing. Like, they never actually say what he's Huffing. You could have just been oxygen. Yeah, true. Didn't seem like it. Certainly. I wonder if they sell one breath used, like one time used. She's one breath. You can just keep it in your pocket. Only one dollar per breath. Yeah. Actually, I discount on that. Yeah. Like a one-hitter quitter for air. What I was gonna say is, um, yeah. Somebody really, like, this is like the first person that bottled water. They're like, no, he's gonna buy this shit, right? This is the same thing. You bottled air? Yeah, dude. People are buying flying off the shelves. In fact, there's only two left. Maybe you've cleared them out. They also sold out of this shit. So people are desperate for air. This is a very high idea. Is there an expiration date? Does the air expire? Good question. Good question. It's a very good question. Certainly one expect air to Uh, expire, but who knows, man. Water expires. Apparently, if you read the date on it. That's true. The same water has been around for like billions of years, but it expires from my... It expires in a year. It's probably from the plastic, though, that leaks into it. Anyway, let's look at some buggy time stamps. Hold on one sec. I'm ready. He makes fun of Buggie. Oh my god, Buggie's had a tattoo parlor right now. Are you fucking for real? I was like dude. Okay there's no fucking reason there's no good reason there's no just a viable reason for him to go get liar tattooed in fact the fact that they even want him to do that at all is just so psychotic and mean like yeah he lied about having cancer and he's not a good dude by any account but What are we doing? And there's a pole right now in their chest should bug you get hand or face and then the super chest is do both. You pathetic dog. This, this, this is, it's pretty sick, man. Yeah. It's pretty sick. Well, I don't know why about, I need none of these time stamps work. Like it's just straight up broken. Okay, so I'll write them all in. So we're doing this one then. That's one ten third that's happening. Yeah, it's so weird. I've never seen that before. Okay, hold on let me. Sorry about this. It's got it. Oh, there's one, do you have the part where Moodahar runs outside with a gun? I don't, but I'm like, dude, dude, these people aren't saying Buggie's not even the craziest one in that room, still. There's a point where Moodahar goes. Oh, shit, someone stealing my car and he runs outside with a gun. And then he comes in 30 seconds into it. Oh, no, it's chill. It's just my brother. like this pseudo badass weird fucking stick he's doing is not it and frankly he's so mean-spirited and nasty and he he has this weird thing where he like he needs to act like cool and that he's so successful and rich he goes he tells buggy Dude, why don't you upload more? I upload every day and YouTube's not even my job. I was like, shut the fuck up bro. I think he considers he thinks his real job is being a deep and day trader. I might be wrong about that, but I mean, that's pretty funny. But like, yes it is, shut up bro. Uploading every day. I really got turned off by modal horror and that one man really did. I think you got it. I think everybody needs to just like stop with this show. I think this show is jumped in the shark. Like Dan said, it was funny, but it's starting to get like, well, I'm catching, like bring this lie about cancer was was funny. It was genuinely a fucked up thing to do, but the grilling about childhood abuse is just Did you watch that? No, I'm, it's worth it. We're not. Then you imagine. It's just so cool. I can imagine. Well, what the fuck? I watched my wall count through you. You know what I mean here on this show. I'm like the viewers when it comes to this. Are you saying I'm a low cow? That wasn't what I was implying, but that is the final idea of what you did. Yeah, right. Yes, that's why it is doing. God damn it. Well, I want this fuck when there's there is an issue I'm writing them all down next to it. So this when you're on is 1 10 30 okay 1 10 30 there we go This is a little tedious by firing him because he was still getting a check. I got insane criticism. I am in the worst situation. This motherfucker had me thinking he was going to kill himself and I had to call the cops. Like this is not fun for me. This is just annoying. Like it's great to have fucking 20,000. No, I have to do it here. It's great that another one of Keemstar's products is. The way he uses that button is madness. It is madness. Number one on all of YouTube. And by the way, we really are number one with, I have more, and you just stop. I have more viewers than you at this exact moment. He's going to clarify that it's in terms of donations and everything. How does he know? How does he know if he's known? It's like a Trump line. It doesn't, you know, this is the number one podcast in the world. Like we say all this time. Yeah. Stop making bold claims. This is the number one show in the world. and everything else like we really are like Josh Pascotaur. I'm sorry you got scammed. It's not a joke. He literally scammed it. I'm sorry you're suicidal. Get fucked. The one thing that was positive for Boogie is that he had a share in this big YouTube channel now. He was making some anchovies. Yeah, he was like, how about to make some anchovies? Some cheddar cheese. All for nothing now. He came stole it from him and now he's working for free. He doesn't need to. He doesn't need to. He just just walked away from me. But he, he does. It sounds like he does need the money. Like he is dead fucking. But he's not getting money, you know? And I don't know. He said he's working for free. No, he got fired. Right. And came start owns the shares so they're not paying him. And came, I think gave him like $2,000 by the sound of it. And then they keep bullying him to making donations. So we made $1,000 donation yesterday before and a $3,000 donation. That's one confused. What incentive does he have? So he wants to get back on the show. He can get back on a show if he humiliates himself enough. And he wins back the audience by doing these challenges like getting his face tattooed. It's better than I like. Don't say reality TV. This is not. No, no, no, no, I wasn't. Good. Good. Good ones. Well, obviously, they're going to let him back on the show because, like, without buggy, it's just Keemstar and wings of redemption, which is the worst content I can possibly ever imagine sitting down and watching. Yeah. Like, so they need buggy. Buggy's the only reason people are watching. He has the leverage here. He does. Why is he not making any money? Like, that it doesn't make any sense. But I think he's in the. He should play art. He's looking for some reason you're watching this play hardball. You hold all the cards in this situation. They don't have a show without you. They need to be paying you. You're going to humiliate. Should we fight a fuss with their lives? Everybody go. Should we? Because they're live right now. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, I don't want to get involved. Actually, no, don't do that. I'm not involved. I don't want to be associated with anything going on there. I'm not involved. I am passive and I'm not approving of what they're doing. Don't touch. Don't touch. No, no, no, no. I'll put your hands through the bar. I don't know. It seems like he bought buggy shares without letting the other partners know. Yeah, he did it. Yeah, and it seems like Wayne, so he could get controlling interest if he didn't have it already, but yeah. The other guy seems like a little turned off by that. Yeah, Wayne's was like he didn't even ask me and you bought. It's so weird. I didn't know what it means. I don't think this show's going to make much money for longer than it is now. Yeah. This is it. It sounds like it's already kind of wearing out. It's welcome. There's no plot lines after this. I mean, this is like when Fussy, too, it was in like a, everyone was watching live. It's like that. I mean, people are watching just to see what happens. If I'm not mistaken, that's what happened with Fuzi and Kim, too, is that they had that company together and then Fuzi sold his shares over to Kim. Oh my god, this is a thing he does. Keep your right contracts on as well next to his play buttons that he thinks. Right. Also just for the audience, Boogie keeps mentioning that this is all happening during his birthday week. I just wanted to throw that in there. Oh, we share a birthday week. He is very manipulative though. He is very very manipulative. So I understand. You're manipulating us. You're manipulating us. You're manipulating us. And then let's see what other ones are worth. uh... reviewing uh... came gets buggy some motivation out god i love it he is the absolute you can motivate him to fucking kill himself Like actually like he like the here is motivating buggy agree about losing but you're not. You're not getting angry about fucking winning. You should be angry about winning. I'm going to fucking win. I'm going to fucking I'm going to succeed. Look, where's that? Why can't you just ship make that shift? It's so simple. You got to go and house. You got to have you? Let's simply be here. Girlfriend? You got dogs? You got all these people that love you and care about you? Who cares that the whole internet is screaming? Oh my god, he fake cancer! Because at the end of the day, you fucking dead! Oh no! Man, the phone's out of the hole! After the whole like cancer fucking, first drop happened and you went off the internet for like 72 hours. What did you do for those three days? What are you doing? I sat in a chair. What are you doing? What are you doing in that chair? What are you doing in that chair? Were you playing video games? Sometimes sometimes I watch the TV. No, you're playing video games most of the time because I pulled up your own way. Anyway, it's just this here. There's one of Kim laughing at Boogie's mom sexually abusing him which I'm not going to click. Dead. Oh, yeah. Boogie explains why he doesn't like Moota. Is that the curry one? Yeah. I guess I'll I'll pull that one up. I had a rewind that I'm like, what, what, what? I do believe that he didn't mean it like in a racer way, but who knows? Let's see. Maybe not intentionally, but it's not intentionally. Not intentionally. I mean, you guys don't just spend calling you on some of the manipulation throughout the years. Come on. I disagree, but it's okay. Well, where do you think he doesn't like mood? That's the context. It's been unfair. Can you just bring up a few points without yelling and screaming? No. Okay. Well, let me make a point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point to point point to point point to point to point point point point point point to point point point point point point point to point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point point Curry didn't do anything to me fucking hot chips didn't do anything to me. I just don't like them. It's okay if I don't like something sometimes you just don't like somebody. That's okay. You just don't like me because I'm fucking. No, there's a lot of other you mentioned curry. I know. Are you racist? Why do you? That feels charming. That's pretty, it's pretty wild. Yeah. That's crazy. Get moot us face. So. It's very loud. It's very, very huge. Very few foods I don't like. They tend to be spicy, so curries the first and the popped of them in mind. All you also mentioned hot chips. They are food that is famous for their hot chips. So I didn't know that. It's just a food. It's just a food I don't like. Why are you waiting me to food? Do you do that with everything? I can't have food. Look, you came over here. He was asking me about spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna pizza. Oh, no. Sometimes. This guy was coming over asking for lunch. Yeah, people get hungry. Let's see. Here, Kim starts to tell him he'll let him back on the show if he tattooes a liar on his face, which apparently might be happening today. And I was watching this and I was like, please, God, this is dumb. Like, don't let this happen. This is so stupid. to truly prove he's sorry for the lying and the manipulation that's been going on for his whole career. Like this cancer thing is just so stupid. All right, the fact that you couldn't wait until confirmation to come out and say you have cancer, that is just so dumb. But I do have pity for you because I know how you get. I know you have these little panic attacks. The best part is I want to interrupt me. No, I'm just reminding you, don't forget, I might still have cancer, so that's exciting. This is my punishment, and this is the only way I feel like me and the audience, and let me open this up so everyone can talk. I want everyone to talk on this one. Bear with me. As long as you've been a subscriber for at least one minute, you're going to be up to speak before I drop this, because this is going to go hot. What? I don't want to watch this. Is this the right time staff? I don't know what that means. That was the motor one, right? And getting a face tag. I gotta get out of this. Yeah, it's just the face tag. Anyway, it's getting crazy. I can't support anymore. I'm retracting my endorsement of the show. No, and I am not fast. And I am the extra cursed dude. No. It's another incident. We got a show. We got a show team running away at 10. Okay. Yeah, it's at two hours and 23 minutes. It's just I don't know if I want to touch on the subjects of just. All right. Let's see. The world needs to see him run. Now it's doing this bullshit again where one fucking open. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. You sounded like my boy Vashi. Okay, I got to get out of this. I'm going in the vortex and I'm getting stuck with like dead air and shit. Remove yourself from the vortex. Unburden yourself from all that has been. And all that ever will be. And all that ever will be. Oh shit. And you think you just fell out of the coconut tree? No. You exist. I can look on it. I just fell out of the coconut tree. Oh, we'll grow. Guess what you just got in the context. Oh, interesting. So there is some weird outage bullshit. Yeah, YouTube's having a bad time at the moment. Someone says they're doing it live. Oh, God. That's this is so like not cool and not nice. Who far had to take it too far? Who could have predicted? I wouldn't be playing with that because Boogie keeps saying that he's like suicide don't stuff and that he wants to not live in all this sad very sad he needs help and I just came search not be playing with this topic. He's the last one too. Yeah, like he learned nothing real nothing My God All right. What do you think? We passed the question off to you. Yeah, do you guys think they've gone too far? Um, how long we've been going? Oh, three hours. Oh, really? Going pretty good amount of time. Yeah. I see if there's anything spicy we can throw in at the top here. Uh, is there anything just funny? Yeah, that's what I'm looking for. You should look in for some sort of running work. Oh, can we please talk about about advance? We watch this clip. People make fun of Kamala Harris for having not no swag. This man is swagless. This clip specifically the end. It made the clip ends. It made me like physically like react. It was like the hardest that cringe in anything in the world. This is feature VP. It is the weirdest thing to me. Democrats say that it is racist to believe. Well, they say it's racist to do anything. I didn't die in Mountain Dew yesterday. And one today, I'm sure they're gonna call that racist, too. But, oh, it's good. I love you guys. You know, people are all right. I don't usually hang out with these kinds of yoke, looking at poor brokies, but you guys are all right. He has a zero swag. It is the weirdest thing to do. He is giving me absolutely nothing. This is, if you guys don't know, the tech bro turned politician. Is he a billionaire or see that rich? No. He's not. He's literally owned by billionaires, so. So, Chady Vance Network, according to this, wait, what? Kind of poor. Yeah, I mean, a little poor. Effective, like, obviously, $10 million is extraordinarily wealthy. However, the way people have been talking about him, like he's something like, I thought he was a billionaire. I mean for Congress those guys are all so fucking rich ridiculous literally poor for Congress probably What is the here gonna ask this to chat you be to what is the average net worth of a Congress person in the United States? What do you guys think you want to guess? I know like when they... What did you ask? What is the average net worth of an American Congress person? I would guess... One million. I think it's probably like 600,000 or something. I think it's going to say more like that. And then I decided to... I feel like the couple really rich ones might bring the average up. So I think... I'm going to guess five million. All right, I don't know. Do you have the answer? I'm a million. What happened? What is it? One million. Oh, wow. What was that the answer? That's my guess. Oh, he's guess. Oh, okay. I think the problem is when you're a junior congressperson, you're usually broke unless you come from money and then as you stay in office, you get to do your insider trading, you get to write books, you get to The insider trading's huge. They make a fortune from that, like all of them. Then Hansi Pelosi portfolio thing is very real from what I understand. Like the people that track her and just follow her. It is absolutely real. It's just, it's illegal. I mean, they're not even breaking the law of doing it. So they're allowed to inside trade. Kind of. I mean, they're not like explicitly allowed to do that. Like that AB are Congress people allowed to inside. I think they are. No, they're not. They have to be careful, but like will they actually get prosecuted for it? Is anybody actually there's no law against it. Don't think that's true. We'll find out. They have the general law of not getting to it is illegal for members of Congress to knowingly trade by or sell stocks based on inside information learning during during the course of their jobs. Yeah, obviously. But then why is it? because they skirt around it. They find ways to make it seem like, no, it's just a coincidence. I mean, a lot of them do do things like they, you know, they like time walk when their buyers are gonna happen and they supposedly don't touch that. Do we actually believe that they have no influence on that? Probably not. Yeah, no. All right, very good. So that's our future VP, guys. Swag the fuck up. My boy. J.D. We have the answer on the average. One million. Oh, shit. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. And that's, that's Congress people specifically, not senators. I think it would jump up quite a bit. There's a lot of senators there. Let's see. Well, their salaries pretty fat. They keep raising it. They raise their own salaries. I think they make like 600,000 a year, no. Maybe congressman? No. 300,000. I think it's like 200. I think they raised it. I think they get themselves raises. And they go, yeah, it's inflation. We got to give ourselves the races. Right. Well, doing jacks down. We're workers here. Currently leaders, wait, the leaders. I don't care about leaders. I want like what the baseline. Valerie's. Well, in salary and net worth, I will two different questions. Valerie's. It is $174,000. Yeah. Well, yeah. Stop. I mean, that's a fantastic. That's what's Valerie. That's a great salary, but yeah. But they also get massive housing, there's and stuff for like, I think there is plenty of perks. I mean, the insider trading thing is pretty big bird. Do you know what I'm saying? Absolutely. Uh, Myron replied to Andrew Tate tweet. What is this? Clicking some of the, Myron replied to a Andrew Tate team tweet. Can I even show this? It's the Nazi thing, isn't it? But he also said, he also wrote something pretty nasty to, it's like way too. It's anti-Semitic and it's like, I think maybe too much. What he wrote? What? Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, probably not. Pretty violent. Shout out to Twitter. Thank you. Cody, go hangin' out with Tana in a hotel room when she was 17. Ooh. Oh, you know that don't we this is a new clip, I guess? Um... Let's see. I can tell you guys the room. I can talk about and stale french fries outside. Fuck off. No! This is just, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no What?

It makes it cremately and I think what happened. She looks so young. She is so young. Oh my god. Is that a baby? No. No. No. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is kind of my YouTube channel. What was your favorite roast today? We just did it so we just filmed this stupid video. Honestly, like... Where are people where you write each other's roasts? I meant the point where I have to collab with Cody Co. I think that's kind of the roast for minutes. I know, me too. I think we're the same position. Now... I'm so bitter in her, you know. I'm just saying call you like that. I'm just gonna cry and I'll... I'm gonna dig nose little bitches day one. What? Wait, what was that about? Been a dick nose little bitch since day one, I guess. Oh, that was an insult somebody said it her. I see. Okay, whatever. It's like we don't need more evidence. We know what happened. And that was kind of my thing, it was like, yeah, they collab. This one was kind of fun. Ultimate H3, villain, villain, slash beef tier list. Uh, this one we're gonna need your guys' thoughts on. Oh, let's go. So let's start from the bottom. Jimmy is in a category of the zone. What's that? Okay. Got it. These are resolved beefs. This was, we have here. We have, we have Brad, Brad, most recently resolved. Brad Barry. Brad Barry, very much resolved. Wait. Bradley Martin. What's happening? Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Brad. Not Brad. Not Brad. Brad. Rice. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, Yeah, Jeff, Mike, Tana, yeah. These are definitely results. Okay. Friends status. Just goofs for sure. BTS, just goofs, your boy. Right. Just goofs, Joe, Joe, just goofs. Brent. Brent, I love him. Markiplier, see no heat. You just said, Brent, what do you want from me? I don't know lunch. Would you just say the wrong name? Why the hell are you just like a logical thing? I really, yeah, but not to fuck with you. What's his name? His name is Brent. Hunter. Why did you say, Brent? I said, Brad, because we kept them up, Brad's. Unintentionally. I think I know it's hard for you to believe that people do this, but sometimes people mispronounce names. You didn't mispronounce. You said a whole last different name. I let you know when you do that. Is there anything else you want to take over, baby? Brad. You said your boy, I was trying to help you out. But that was fun. I was saying your boy, I was fine. I could have been there. That was your boy. Okay. You fought him. I don't know what I mean. Like I met him once through the show because you fought. Guys, let him in a panic attack. Oh, you know what? That's a good point. Somebody said, is do little? Resolved? I would say no. I don't like him. Because these people are friendly with. True. Yeah. Do little. Yeah. You can go and build another week. Maybe you can go to a potential bridge? Okay. Here's a thing. Markiplier is actually an enemy of the show for that cream pie block. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He didn't even know who did you. He I think I we have beef. I decided. You decided not to not just go. Actually, I think I burned through this whole can. No, getting light. It is that good for like 15 bucks. Well, it's like Philly D. We're just goofing in. It's a card a bunch. No, no. Try guys. We're just goofing. That's accurate. Potential bridge. Bobby. Bobbi, is this just cats in general? Yeah, that's more than that. Yeah, that's true. See man, I don't think there's a bridge potential. He betrayed me and the most fucked up. Don't say that. I'm out. He got him out. He was misled. No, he's what? That's what a stray. Come on. Dude, he turned. People make mistakes. He was like the most heinous shit. He apologised. I know, and I appreciate that, but it's the bridge's burned. There's no coming back from that. For me? That's so sad. The circle of trust is broken. He's such an interesting human being. You will, as he emailed you, as he reached out. Not since messaging and apologizing. No, I mean, that was the last time I've heard from him. He'll be back one day. That's how I feel. I feel injured by what he did. Still holding a grudge against C man. I get that. He accused me of like sexually harassing him. I was like the fuck. putting that out there during a time. I think I don't remember what was happening, but it's just like another time when everyone was shooting on me for something. I don't remember what. Potential bridge with dad. Yeah. I'm open to that. Moodahar. I'm probably not after today. Move him down. Or up, I guess. Right. Up is the bad direction. Nicocados, bridgeable, ninjas definitely bridgeable. Trisha. I'll say this, if it was just up to me, absolutely, bridgeable. Yeah, I was gonna say, that's a definite answer. Well, if it was up to me, I know. I'm well aware, there's wider context going on, but. But that context isn't on the screen, it's just her. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. England. The entire, uh, um, English Empire, the British Empire. I don't know. Kind of know. That's a bridge too far. That bridge will just fall down from what I understand. We don't have the London bridge is falling down my friend. Villains of the week, let's take a look here. This one's interesting. Haven preach, eggs of knowledge. You know, I can't always teeter back and forth between bridge building and not with them, but it always comes down to not. I think about it for too long. It's right. There's no bridge. It's such a shame what happened at tip. But yeah, he kind of lost the plot there. All right, we lost him. He died on the hill. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know where we're visiting. Listen, we lost a lot of good soldiers that day. Yeah. It's a shame. Why do the good always die young? Jared, I don't have to. Jared, let go. Yeah. At the top here, uh, big neck. Um, villain of the week. I feel like he's, he's turned into long, long time recurring villain stuff. Yeah. Major recurring villain. Yeah, I'd say so. You're telling me they're Like we talk about him pretty consistently and he's pretty consistently saying and doing awful things. I don't know. I agree. He should get a promotion. Yeah. Leverking is right there, sniper wolf, Steve will do it. The next year I'm guy. Brad and Brendan Shob. I think he can be moved up too. Because Shob? Yeah. I don't think so. What do you like talk about him? We don't talk about them that often. Like we talk about big Nick. I don't follow him. I don't care what he's doing. Big Nick, I'm fascinated by, you know. Um, Dem, uh, what's your name? I like Dem. I like Mugs. The Yogurt Girl. Yeah, Dem, Dem. Dem. Uh, we love it. To be the whole family though, I'm not sure. No. Prank invasion. It's, I don't know. It's pretty, they'll know the week. I mean, she's, when was that week? The long week ago. Yeah, I mean, some of these are older, but like there isn't really a, Maybe there should be another category for, like, retired villains. Yeah. That aren't necessarily, like, they've been forgiven, but they've just- They've faded into the distance. Tie would be there. Right. Pain rack would definitely be there, Jeremy. Fussy. Gary V. Ricecom. XQC. This dipshit. This dipshit. Yeah, that's pretty good. Except for a big neck, I said, that's accurate. Major reoccurring villains, let's see. AI in, sure, for the gag. Jay station. He was, but he's retired. Again, he's kind of retired. Yeah. But I guess we don't have that retirement category. He was a recurring villain for a while, for sure. Adam Ross, the Streamy Awards, Joey Salads, Colleem, Crouter, Peterson, Tate, and Ted Cruz, Leafy, Buggie, Dr. Justfek, Logan, Timpool, Donald Trump, Matt Walsh, Elon Musk, Fretchenfit, Michael Jackson, brutal, Bosch, Ben Shapiro, Oliver Tree. This is Helen Keller, I believe. Oliver Tree sandwiched between Michael Jackson and Ellie Keller. That's pretty long. Jake Paul and what was his name? Patrice Wilson. James Charles, Shane Dawson, Sneak, Jason Ash. Yeah, those are pretty accurate. And then up here we have the H3 Sinister Sick. Scary. came star definitely a white Harvey Weinstein here never talks about him the granted he's not a good guy that's uh... that's uh... that's a bit of uh... of form of relativity uh... video head yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah, so yeah, he would belong there Ryan Cabin. Jay Shetty that yeah, yeah blue-eyed demon. I don't know if Matt Hoss like that talk about retired uh I mean he was a huge villain once upon a time but like that that's like the villain from like season two of the show and we're on season like well at this point. Yeah, I mean like I can't agree with this. I think Matt Haas is out doing his own thing and I'm doing my own thing we're not crossing past. I think that's good and I like it like keep it that way. Yeah. So we're gonna have to put him somewhere else. But David Dobrik, yes, the entire snark subreddit. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I don't know where Dave goes. It's just like a hive mind. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm more like Bill into the week. Yeah. Yeah, you know. Yeah, I agree. It's like occasionally. I love him. But then this is my biggest, uh- Yeah. The one who wins is Nancy's soul cycle. Do we have a way of speaking to Nancy? Yeah, I feel like we did a film and it was like totally funny baloney, but that's why I'm that's why I don't fucking baloney just like I called it that old hag is not real and when I said I hope she chokes on a verbal I meant it I hope that won't happen. You don't choke to death on a fur ball. I know you don't mean it. You don't. You want the best for Nancy Seals cycle. You told me. I hope she gets what do you call the cats give you the brain disease loved by cats I hope she get she's what does that call her cats talk so plaque plus yeah something like that I've never heard of it so something it's a real thing that I've not a to learn about X you know about that no I talk so much of Moses talk yet it makes rats fucking suicide themselves so cats can eat them oh my god we're all walking around like I was about to go on a tangent. But to be honest, it doesn't seem to affect humans at all. Or at least we don't know how. Could have worked mysteriously. We don't know. I learned the other day there's like a fungus that infects ants and mind controls them. I learned about that for the first time. That was the craziest thing I'd ever learned. which isn't good because that's the plot of like a lot of zombies stuff. Yeah, it makes them jump out of the trees and go hide underneath a leaf. And then they just they the like bacteria fungus comes out and then they die. Just so they can use their body for new things. Yeah, so scary. I remember in college I wrote a script for a short zombie film that had that concept. This was in 2000. They got it from you. No, not at all. It's likely. But I was annoyed when that game came out and it was great and it was that exact concept. It is a great. It is kind of the most realistic. One, I think it came into the public consciousness because there was like a, was it? There was like a big nature documentary that talked about it in like the 2000s. And that was where I had heard about it. And I imagined the creator of that game probably was inspired by the same thing. Yeah, anyway, I was saying I hope that source, like, on Nancy, has fatal talk, so it's close. I hope she lives a long and prosperous day. Did you act dude, what the fuck man? You think we'll stay late? We're not. I guess, you know. You're right. Is that real? What a fucking idiot. Ugh. All right. What are we talking about? We're at a time, folks. We haven't, we did it. Um, let's do the big ask. He's the tape on that side. Do that. Wow. That's crazy dude. As you can see, the night is falling and it is time to say good night, but fret not my wonderful audience. And what's again? Thank you to the 67% who backed me up on that very, somewhat, I want to say very, but somewhat risky joke, and I appreciate you guys, because comedy is a lot. When you take a risk, sometimes it lands, sometimes it doesn't, in here, didn't really land. I think that's a little risk. On the audience, still a little bit better. That is fucking funny, and I do not need any of your approval, right? Okay, love. Don't you want to be right baby? Right Zach Zach was hooking it up yucking it up funny joke. Yeah. Hell yeah. You're right. You don't need our approval. You are right. I got Zach. Anyway, I was saying thank you to all of our gracious supporters and donors.

But, um, because he's not just an ad salesman, he's so much more. You know, he brings so much to the table development, not just that smile and beautiful dome. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. I'm not in it. This is the one here. Okay. We're working on it. Was that the end of the song? You want more? Yeah, that's what I thought. You got the music play in the song. Thank you, though, for everyone who's watching, appreciate you.
